//! Reader-level reactive state, one file per domain: the document, the viewer
//! signals, the zoom pipeline's shape, search, the AI text selection and the
//! gloss marks. Pure UI chrome (sidebar, toast) lives in `state/ui` +
//! `state/app`; pure domain logic in `reader-core` and the format crates.
//!
//! This module is the barrel. Everything below used to be one 650-line file,
//! which meant a page that only wanted `ViewerSignals` read the document, the
//! search state and the gloss marks to find it, and any change to any of them
//! touched the same file. The domains have nothing to say to each other beyond
//! the struct at the bottom that owns one of each — with the single exception
//! of the format questions the chrome keeps asking, which is exactly why they
//! are answered here, once, as [`ReaderState::reflowable`].
