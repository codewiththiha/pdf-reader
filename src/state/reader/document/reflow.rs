//! The reflowable half of the open document: its blocks, and the page cut the
//! reader is currently reading them through.
//!
//! The PDF keeps its content in the engine; a plain-text or Markdown document
//! keeps its content HERE — the whole file parsed into blocks the moment it
//! opens (`txt_core::parse_plain_text` and `md_core::parse_markdown`, both
//! cutting through `reflow_core::block`). The paginator (`reflow_core::pager`)
//! packs those blocks into A4 pages, and the result is published as three
//! parallel signals the layouts read:
//!
//! * `heights` — every block's height at scale 1. Seeded by the pure
//!   estimate, replaced by the DOM's real measurement once the measure
//!   column has rendered once;
//! * `cuts` — the page split those heights produce;
//! * `block_page` — the inverse map (block → page), what navigation and
//!   search resolve positions through.
//!
//! The three are always written together ([`ReflowContent::apply_heights`]),
//! because a split that disagrees with its map would send a page jump to the
//! wrong block.
