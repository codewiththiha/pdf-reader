//! The library domain: the books, the shelves they are filed on, the folders
//! watched for new ones, the cover-art cache, and the view the shelf renders
//! in.
//!
//! The RULES are not here — they are `library_core`, which is pure and
//! host-tested. This module is the reactive half: the signals those rules are
//! applied to, the import dock's task list, and the cover cache's own budget.
//!
//! Kept OUT of `Settings` on purpose, for the reason the previous schema gave
//! and this one inherits: reading position changes on every page turn, while
//! `Settings` is the appearance blob that repaints and re-serialises on every
//! write. The library's own view knobs (columns, sort, cover fit) change at the
//! same pace as a page turn, so they ride with the library rather than joining
//! the settings blob — one localStorage key, one write schedule.
//!
//! That schedule is unchanged: reading progress saves on a debounce through
//! `crate::effects::reader::reading_progress`, and the last moments before a
//! teardown (a document closing, a book leaving the shelf) write immediately
//! through `crate::storage::persist_library`, because a debounced save there is
//! a save that may never land.
