//! The list: one row per book and one row per shelf — the level as a tree that
//! unfolds in place, for a library the reader is scanning rather than browsing.
//!
//! Same books, same order, same drag rules and the same three gestures as the
//! grid — the only thing that changes is the shape of a row, which is why the
//! order arrives from the same context signal rather than being derived a second
//! time here. A reader who switched to the denser layout has not thereby lost the
//! way in, the way out, or the hold that starts a selection.
//!
//! Shelves are rows here now, and were not before: the shelf tile only ever
//! rendered in the grid, so the dense layout was the books and the way in. A
//! shelf row unfolds — the shelves filed in it and its own books indent under it,
//! as deep as the forest goes — while the way in stays a separate gesture: the
//! row's Open drills the breadcrumb route, and the row itself only unfolds.
//! Splitting the two is the disclosure's whole contract, because unfolding is a
//! way of LOOKING and must never move the reader: a tree that navigated on expand
//! could not be scanned without being travelled. Which shelves are unfolded is
//! this component's own memory and is never persisted — the tree is a way of
//! looking at the library, and the forest the library stores is the same one
//! whichever layout is showing it.
//!
//! A search divides the tree the way the page divides it: the doors narrow by
//! name, with the same rule `crate::features::library::content` filters the
//! grid's folders with, and the matches themselves are the flat list's alone —
//! an unfolded shelf withholds its members while a query is open, because the
//! root search already lists every match in the library and the same book twice
//! at two indents is one book too many.
//!
//! A row is the same drop target a card is, and registers under the same kind: a
//! book at one density and the same book at the other are one thing to a drag, and
//! a session that had to be told which layout was showing would be a session that
//! could only drop on the one the reader happened to be looking at. The tree's
//! rows carry one fact a card never had to: the shelf whose member list renders
//! them, so a drop inside an expanded branch lands in the branch and not in the
//! level the page is on. A shelf row is a target in its own right — its middle
//! takes a hold inside, its outer quarters reorder held folders beside it, and a
//! hold that rests on a collapsed one opens it, the courtesy every file manager's
//! tree gives a drag. And a shelf row is a LIFT as well as a landing: a hold
//! enters the selection with the shelf in it and a movement picks it up — the
//! same wiring the grid's folder card wears — so a folder is draggable at both
//! densities, watched or not, and a set of books and folders lifts as one.
//!
//! A row shows the author when the book has one and the resume point when it does
//! not: at this density there is room for one line of prose and the reader gets to
//! choose which by opening the book.
//!
//! ## The tree is a component, not a layout
//!
//! [`ShelfTree`] is the whole recipe — which root to walk and how dense to draw —
//! as a plain prop bag, and nothing under it reads a context the reader's sidebar
//! could not provide (the right-click's host is asked for, not expected). The
//! sidebar's shelf tab mounts the same tree with `dense`: file-name rows whose
//! format chip stands in for the cover art, because at that width the kind of
//! thing a row is earns the pixels the art would cost. When it gets there, the
//! rows' gestures stand down with the page's hosts: a tree with no drag session
//! and no menu keeps the tap and the disclosure and nothing else (see
//! `crate::features::library::gestures`).
