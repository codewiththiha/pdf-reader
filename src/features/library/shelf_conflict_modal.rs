//! The folder's question: a level already holds the name.
//!
//! A folder arriving under a name its level holds is the shelf's own spelling
//! of the collision the book sheet asks about — two doors of one name on one
//! level are two doors a reader cannot tell apart — and it is asked BEFORE the
//! walk rather than after it, because the answer decides what the walk is for.
//! WHICH answers the sheet offers is the arrival's mode, and the two sets are
//! the two ways a folder can be held:
//!
//! A STORED arrival — copies the library owns, unrelated to any tree — gets
//! the level's own three: *show it* goes and lights the shelf that is here
//! and imports nothing, *replace* sends the books the shelf holds out through
//! the removal's sweep and seats the arriving copies on it, and *as new*
//! mints a shelf of the next free name. Of ground the library already READS
//! IN PLACE, the *as new* tree holds copies of its own — independent books of
//! their own bytes beside the linked ones the old tree keeps — and the
//! *replace* is the import module's own log-spending sweep, so the copies
//! take the shelf the linked books left.
//!
//! A READ-AT-PLACE arrival keeps two answers: *make link* leaves a pointer at
//! the sheet that is here, and *merge into it* files the folder's books onto
//! it, a book whose name it already holds asking one by one on the compact
//! sheet — at every level of the tree that already stands, with an
//! apply-to-all switch for a reader who has seen enough to answer for the
//! rest. Its *as new* is withheld: a second shelf of one linked folder is the
//! second instance the family gate exists to prevent. And a read-at-place
//! arrival of its OWN family never reaches this sheet at all — the gate in
//! `crate::services::library::import` answers it with a light, a
//! continuation, or the fold back into the tree its directory names.
//!
//! A folder colliding with its OWN previous shelf asks too — a re-import that
//! ended on "Imported 0 books" with no sheet in between was the silent
//! nothing this exists to stop — and the sheet words it as the continuation
//! it is.
//!
//! A drag never asks this: nesting a shelf writes a parent rather than a
//! membership, so nothing arrives on a level for a name to collide with — the
//! rule `crate::services::library::arrange` gives. And a watched folder's own
//! rescan never asks either: staying quiet is a rescan's whole job.
