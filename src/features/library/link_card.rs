//! A link row: the shelf's own card and row shape, with a pointer's facts on it
//! instead of a book's.
//!
//! A link is not a book and cannot borrow a book's card — it has no address to
//! read, no page to render art from, no resume point to draw a bar for and no
//! format to name. What it has is a name (the name of the book it points at,
//! which is what makes it recognisable beside it), a target, and the same three
//! gestures every other row on the shelf answers to: a tap goes to the book, a
//! hold selects it, a movement files it somewhere else. So it wears the shelf's
//! own item shell — `crate::features::library::shelf_item`, the one wiring a
//! card and a list row both wear — and the plate where a cover would be says
//! what it is instead.
//!
//! The one thing a link does that no book does is open somewhere else: a tap
//! reveals the book it points at, on the shelf that book is filed on, and lights
//! its card (`crate::services::library::reveal_book`). That is the whole of the
//! row's purpose, and it is why a link is a row the reader can file anywhere
//! without ever moving a file.
