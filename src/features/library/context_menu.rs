//! The shelf's right-click: one menu per kind of thing under the pointer.
//!
//! A card used to answer a right-click with the removal receipt and nothing else,
//! which is one row of a menu wearing the whole gesture. The receipt is still what
//! a removal costs and still asks first — it is just reached from a row now, beside
//! the things a right-click is actually for: opening, selecting, finding a book
//! whose address died, taking a shelf apart.
//!
//! One host and one signal, for the reason the removal sheet is one: a right-click
//! can land on a card, a row, a folder or the empty shelf, and four surfaces each
//! owning a menu is four placements, four dismissals and four sets of rows to keep
//! in step. So the surfaces ask and this answers, and the payload says which menu.
//!
//! The primitive underneath is `crate::components::primitives::floating::context_menu`,
//! which owns the cursor placement, the viewport clamp and the dismissal; what is
//! here is the library's half — what a right-click on each kind of thing means.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not start a drag: a menu row
//! is clicked with a pointer that has already been released, so a session begun
//! from one would have no pointer to follow and no release to end it, and the next
//! click anywhere would be the drop. And it does not fork a second shelf picker —
//! "file these somewhere" is the selection bar's popover, which is on screen
//! whenever a selection is, and a menu that rebuilt it would be a second answer to
//! the same question.
