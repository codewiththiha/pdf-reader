/// The move sheet's three, re-spelled for an arrival with no row of its own:
/// there is nothing to fold INTO the shelf's row yet, so *merge* is the file
/// handing the row its measurement rather than two rows becoming one. Smaller
/// than the import sheet on purpose: the shelf's question is already answered,
/// and a sheet that re-explained the whole situation per file would be a
/// sentence the reader has to re-read forty times.
