//! The two-answer sheet, and the two facts that raise it: a loose import of a
//! file that sits inside a folder the library reads in place, where that folder's
//! book for it is alive and standing; or a loose import of a file whose content
//! the library already holds, wherever it is filed.
//!
//! Two answers rather than three because the third a name collision offers — a
//! pointer at a row on THIS level — has nothing to point at in either case: the
//! row the library holds is not on this level, and a second linked row of one
//! read-at-place file is the one thing that rule never makes. Which fact was
//! noticed decides the sentence above the buttons and nothing else.

/// What is left after the stronger question has been asked. A covered file's
/// folder has already answered what a name collision would ask, and a file whose
/// content the library holds is a book the reader has rather than a name a level
/// is short of; in both cases the honest choice is a second instance or the first
