//! The one element every shelf item is.
//!
//! Six surfaces answer to the shelf's press contract — the grid's book card
//! and its link, the list's book row and its link, the grid's folder card and
//! the tree's shelf row — and before this file each of them wore the same
//! sixty lines to do it: the two host lookups, the wiring's eleven-field
//! spread, the drop-target registration, the seven reactive state classes and
//! the seven pointer attributes. Six copies of one contract is six places it
//! can drift, and a drift here is a gesture that works on a card and not on
//! the row of the same book.
//!
//! So the shell owns the whole outer element — id, role, tabindex, aria, the
//! handlers, the registration and the state classes — and a surface hands it
//! four things that are actually the surface's: the class VOCABULARY its CSS
//! speaks ([`SeamVocab`]), its base classes, the wiring's policy
//! ([`ShelfItemPolicy`]) and its inner content. Anything else a surface
//! paints about itself — the reveal's light, a missing book's grey — arrives
//! as an extra reactive class, because those are facts about the item and not
//! part of the shared contract.
//!
//! The hosts are asked for here rather than expected, once for every surface:
//! the library page provides both, and a mount that provides neither — the
//! reader sidebar's shelf tab — gets rows that keep their tap and disclosure
//! and stand the rest down. That question used to be answered per surface,
//! and two of the six answered it wrong.
