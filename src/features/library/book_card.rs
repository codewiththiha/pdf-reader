//! One book on the shelf: a cover in a frame, a title, and the two things a
//! library needs that a recents list never did — a drag handle, and a way back
//! when the address the book points at dies.
//!
//! The cover sits in a frame (`.book-cover-wrap` in `styles/library.css`) rather
//! than carrying its own shadow, spine gradient and fore-edge. Three reasons, and
//! the first is the one that decided it: the reading-progress bar belongs at the
//! bottom of the ART, and a bar under the title is a bar the eye has to leave the
//! cover to find. A frame that clips gives the bar a box to be flush with, and
//! gives the lift, the ring and the selection outline one element to be painted on
//! instead of four. The second is that the skeuomorphic spine and fore-edge were
//! two pseudo-elements spent on a decoration, and third is that a shelf of
//! mixed page sizes reads calmer as one row of frames than as one row of volumes.
//!
//! The prop is the row the `For` keyed this card on, and a keyed row is not
//! re-created when the row's CONTENT changes — a startup measurement marking the
//! book missing, a relink moving its address, a conflict sheet's rename, a fold
//! merging a twin into it. So the facts that can move are read back out of the
//! state by id (the rule the folder card and the list's tree rows follow), and
//! the prop supplies the identity: which book this card is.
//!
//! The card's outer element is the shelf's one item shell
//! (`crate::features::library::shelf_item`): the press contract, the drop
//! registration and the state classes are its, and what is left here is the
//! card's own content and the two classes that are facts about the BOOK — the
//! reveal's light and the missing grey.
