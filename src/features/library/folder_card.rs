//! A shelf on the page, drawn as a folder: a 2×2 plate of what is inside it —
//! covers for its books and a plate of their own for its folders, recursively —
//! then its name and what it holds.
//!
//! It replaces the shelf tile, which spanned the whole grid as a row of spines
//! on a board. That shape could not nest — a row is a section, and a section
//! cannot be inside another section — so a shelf inside a shelf had nowhere to
//! be drawn. A folder is a cell like a book's, which is what makes every level
//! of the library the same shape as the one above it.
//!
//! Called a folder because that is what it looks like; the domain word stays
//! *shelf*, because *folder* already means a watched directory in
//! `library_core`, and the two are different facts about the same row (see
//! [`Shelf::parent`]'s note on `ShelfKind::Folder`).
//!
//! Three gestures share the card and the shelf's one wiring decides between
//! them — `crate::features::library::gestures`, on the
//! `crate::components::primitives::interactions::draggable_item` wrapper. A tap
//! opens the shelf, a hold starts a multi-select with this shelf already in it,
//! and a movement hands the press to `crate::features::library::dnd`, which is
//! what files a book dropped on it or nests a shelf dropped on it.
//!
//! Every card drags, including one cut from a watched folder. A scan mints such a
//! shelf on the rung its directory has on disk and re-hangs it there — but the
//! reader's hand beats the disk's shape: the move is marked on the row
//! (`library_core::shelf::Shelf::manual_parent`), the next re-hang passes it by,
//! and the shelf keeps its disk knowledge through the move, so files its folder
//! scans later still land inside it wherever the reader filed it.
//!
//! A drop this folder refuses — a shelf that would end up inside itself — wears no
//! ring at all, which is the honest half of the gesture: the decision table says
//! no before the pointer gets there, so the reader is never offered a drop that
//! the commit step would then quietly decline.
