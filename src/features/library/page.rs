//! The library route (`/`): the shelf, and a title bar that is navigation rather
//! than chrome.
//!
//! The bar keeps the reader's shape — leading cluster, centred slot, trailing
//! cluster, the built-in pin — and changes what each is for. Left is where you
//! are (the breadcrumb), centre is how to narrow it (the search), right is how it
//! looks (the view menu) plus the app's own colours (the appearance menu, which
//! drops its page-texture section here: the shelf has no page to texture). Its
//! pin is the library's OWN memory, kept in its own settings field and defaulted
//! to pinned — the shelf's bar is how the reader moves, and unhitching the
//! reader's bar out of a document's way says nothing about it.
//!
//! There is no Open button and no Import button: adding books is a shelf
//! affordance (the `+` card, the empty state, a drop) rather than a title-bar
//! one, because a bar button that opens a picker is a button that hides the
//! library's real door. And no settings button: settings are the reader's —
//! zoom, typography, motion, the AI — and none of them paints a pixel of the
//! shelf, so the gear lives on the bar that has something for it to say.
//!
//! No sidebar, no zoom, no mode, no document search: those are reader-only, so
//! the shell controller this page provides is rail-less and the bar keeps the
//! full window width, its gutter and its lights.
