//! “This book is not where the library left it.”
//!
//! The question a click on a missing book asks instead of opening the reader
//! onto an error: two doors that point the row at the file it is now — pick
//! the file yourself, or name a folder and let the app walk it looking for a
//! file of the book's own name — and a Cancel that changes nothing, because a
//! missing book is a book the library is still holding a place for.
//!
//! Raised by the open's dead-address gate ([`crate::services::document::open`]
//! hands a `missing` row to `crate::services::library::ask_relink` rather
//! than to the engine) and answered by
//! `crate::services::library::arrange::relink`, which re-measures whatever
//! the reader names before it promises anything.
