//! Multi-select on the shelf: the gesture that starts it, the set it fills, and
//! the bar that acts on it.
//!
//! The gesture is the app's one card wrapper at the app's one hold tuning, so
//! holding a book feels exactly like holding a highlight — same delay, same
//! swallowed click afterwards — and holding a folder feels exactly like holding a
//! book. See `crate::components::primitives::interactions::draggable_item` for why
//! one wrapper decides between the hold, the tap and the drag rather than three
//! listeners racing. The bar is the `ActionBar` primitive, which has named library
//! item selection as a consumer since before there was a library to select from.
//!
//! The set holds ids and does not care which kind they are: a selection of books
//! and folders is one selection, because that is what the reader sees on screen.
//! What a selection can DO is narrower than what it can hold, deliberately, and the
//! two halves are different operations on the same shelf list. Filing a book is
//! membership; filing a folder is nesting, which `library_core::shelf::can_nest`
//! refuses when it would close a loop and `Shelf::is_folder` refuses outright for
//! a shelf the disk places — its rung is the watched tree's, not the selection's. Removing goes through the receipt sheet a
//! single removal uses, and the sheet receipts both halves at once: a book's row
//! itemises what it takes with it, a shelf's row says what SURVIVES it — the books
//! stay in the library, the shelves inside it move up a level, and a shelf cut from
//! a watched folder says the folder keeps watching. One gesture, one confirmation,
//! one honest receipt.
//!
//! A keyboard cannot hold anything down, so it gets the same two halves as two
//! keys: Shift+Enter on a card enters selection with that card in it, and Enter
//! inside selection toggles. The mode is reachable without a pointer, which is the
//! only reason a bulk action on this shelf is not a mouse-only feature.
//!
//! A drag picks the set up rather than starting one — see [`payload_for`]. The
//! bar's "Add to shelf" is the deliberate half of a bulk move and a drag is the
//! quick half, and the two have to agree about what "the selection" is holding or
//! a reader who lifts three books and drops them on a folder gets something other
//! than what the bar said they had.
