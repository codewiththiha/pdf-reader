//! The frontend half of the AI word-explanation feature.
//!
//! Owns the wire protocol with the Tauri backend: [`invoke_explain_word`]
//! starts a run (fire-and-forget — results never come back through the
//! invoke) and [`install_ai_chunk_bridge`] registers ONE app-lifetime Tauri
//! listener that re-broadcasts each chunk as a window `CustomEvent`
//! (`pdfreader:ai-chunk`). The gloss popover (and anything else) then
//! listens on the window, so document switches never stack dead Tauri
//! handlers or drop the live one.
