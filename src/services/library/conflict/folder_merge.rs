/// One of the compact sheet's three buttons, in the unified vocabulary.
///
/// The three are [`Placement::FOLDER_MERGE`]: *merge*, *replace* and *keep
/// both*. *Open* is not among them — the reader is importing the folder, so
/// "go and look at the shelf" is not an answer to a file inside it.
///
/// `apply_all` is the switch beside them: checked, the answer is given to every
/// folder-merge question in the queue as well — a reader who has seen one file of
/// a forty-file folder and knows what the whole folder is does not owe the sheet
/// thirty-nine more clicks. A book question that is NOT a folder-merge one stops
/// the drain: it belongs to another gesture and gets its own sheet.

/// Two of the three go through the unified apply, which is the point: *merge* and

/// row, and the two disagreed about the edges. What a folder merge adds to them is
/// the ledger — the placement has to be recorded in the folder that is merging,
/// and a removal that was holding the file out spent — so that rides the answer
/// here rather than in the apply, which knows nothing about folders.
///
/// *Keep both* does not go through the apply at all, and the reason is the folder:
/// a file landing on a shelf the folder's own walk minted lands linked when the
/// folder reads in place and as a store copy when it does not, and only the ask's
/// kind carries that mode. The generic landing would copy a file the folder is
/// supposed to be reading in place, which is the one mistake this sheet exists to
