//! A dead address, re-pointed: the reader picks a file — or a FOLDER, and the
//! app walks it looking for the book's own name — and the book reads from
//! there. A linked book takes the address, a stored book takes a fresh copy
//! of it, made before anything is written so a failure leaves the row exactly
//! as it was.
//!
//! The sheet is the door an open of a dead address walks through
//! ([`ask_relink`]): a click on a book the library knows is gone asks the
//! Find-again question instead of opening the reader onto an error, and the
//! two answers are the two doors — pick the file yourself, or name a folder
//! and let the walk find the name. The card's own button and the right-click's
//! row still go straight to the file picker, which is the one door a reader
//! who knows where the file moved to wants.
