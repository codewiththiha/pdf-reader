/// One spelling for the three moves that owe a departure — a drag between

/// — because the ORDER is the whole of the rule. The copy is made and the row is
/// converted BEFORE any shelf write happens, so every screen, sheet and
/// membership edit downstream sees the books as what they are about to be rather
/// than as what they were when the hand lifted. Three copies of this were three
/// places to get that order wrong.
///
/// A copy that fails costs that book its move and nothing else: it stays where it
/// was, linked, the toast says so, and the other books in the same drag still go.
/// `retry` runs the move over the survivors and is called from the spawned task,
/// which is what lets the caller return at once and keep its own shape.
///
/// `retry` takes the survivors AND the rows this gate turned into copies, because
/// the landing owes them one exception: a departure writes a moved-out log, and
/// the copy then lands — often on another shelf of the very folder it left, which
/// is where a reader re-arranging a watched tree puts it. [`bind_returned`] reads
/// a stored book landing on a shelf of the folder it left as the book coming
/// HOME, and a log bound to a row is one a later import answers by lighting that
/// row up instead of bringing the linked book back. One gesture cannot be both
/// the departure and the return, so the rows this gate converted are named to the
/// landing and the bind stands aside for them; a drag of the same row back on a
/// LATER gesture is a return and binds as it always did.
