/// What the folder sheet's answer decided about the run's root, before the run.
///
/// The default is the run nobody asked about: mint the folder's root shelf
/// under the folder's own name. A collision at the level changes that, and
/// the change is a value rather than a branch at six call sites:
///
///   * `rename` — the *as new* answer's name: the root rung is minted under
///     the counter the sheet promised rather than under the folder's own;
///   * `into` — the *merge* answer's shelf: the folder's root rung IS the
///     shelf the level already held, and every file the walk finds at the
///     root files into it;
///   * `continuation` — the shelf an already-imported read-at-place re-pick
///     names: the tree's root shelf for its own root, the rung's shelf for a
///     rung of it. It is the shelf the run LIGHTS when the walk found
///     something — the reader picked that ground and that ground is what
///     answers — and the note a walk that found NOTHING new owes the reader
///     after the fact: the reconciliation ran, every book was already here,
///     and the shelf lights up when the note closes. A run that found
///     something answers with the landing and the card instead, and a rescan
///     never carries one.
///   * `fold` — the family tree and the rung key this run's folder goes back
///     to when the walk ends: `(tree id, rel)`. An import of a folder is the
///     reader wanting it BACK, and back is the rung its directory names in the
///     in-place tree that covers it — so the walk runs on the pick's own
///     ledger and the run's last act folds the standing shelf into the family
///     (`reclaim_rung`), the seat the disk names rather than the level the
///     pick would otherwise mint on. Set by the gate for a pick inside a
///     family whose rung is gone, and for a re-pick of a folder that is
///     itself standing outside its family; a rescan never carries one.

/// books" with no sheet in between is the silent nothing the book collision
/// used to be. A folder colliding with its OWN previous shelf asks too — the

///
/// The read-at-place gate in front of all of it belongs to the READ-AT-PLACE
/// arrival alone, and it is the family's answer rather than the level's
/// (`covered_shelf`, `library_core::shelf::family_for`). A linked shelf IS an
/// OS folder, so which tree the pick belongs to is a question about the
/// ground and not about where the reader happens to be standing:
///
///   * ground the family already holds — the tree's OWN root re-picked, or
///     any RUNG of a tree the library reads in place — cannot mint a second
///     instance, and is not a bare sentence either: it is a RECONCILIATION.
///     The covering tree's walk runs on the reader's own ask — new files join
///     the tree as linked books, the logs a removal or a departure wrote are
///     spent by their books coming back — on the TREE's ledger, where a rung
///     has no second door to mint, and the shelf the pick named is the shelf
///     that lights up. Only a walk that found NOTHING raises the note, and a
///     tree that is itself a member standing outside another goes back inside
///     it on the run's answer, because an import of a folder is the reader
///     wanting it home. A book removed inside a rung comes back on a re-pick
///     of the rung exactly as on a re-pick of the root: both are the reader
///     asking the tree for its books again;
///   * a rung the family's ledger names but no shelf wears — deleted, or
///     departed as a copy — imports BACK INTO THE FAMILY: the walk runs on
///     the pick's own ledger, and the run's last act folds the shelf it
///     minted onto the rung its directory names (`RootPlan::fold`), lit
///     where it stands again. Importing a subfolder of a tree is how a
///     deleted rung comes back, not how a second door is made;
///   * a tree whose root rung a hand took OUT — the shelf's own departure —
///     arrives with no shelf and no family slot to name, and simply walks:
///     the copy the departure made wears the level's counter name and left
///     the folder's own name free, so the run re-mints the tree on the seats
///     the disk names and lights what came back.
///
/// A STORED arrival asks the family nothing: copies are the library's own
/// second instance, unrelated to any tree, and the only question they have is
/// the name one at the level they land on — the ordinary sheet, whose answers
/// for a stored arrival are the level's own three (go and look at the shelf
/// that is here, replace it, or a shelf of the next free name). The sheet
