//! The one-time move of every stored copy into the book's own item folder.
//!
//! The store used to be flat and name-derived — `<Library>/<format>/<stem>_<id>.<ext>`
//! — and is now one folder per book (`<Library>/items/<id>/source.<ext>`,
//! [`library_core::store`]). Copies made since that change are already there;
//! copies made before it keep the address recorded in their row, so they still
//! open, but they sit in a layout nothing writes any more and have no directory
//! of their own for a cover or a set of marks to live in.
//!
//! This is the pass that brings them across, and it is self-limiting rather than
//! run-once: the rows it moves are written back, so the next launch finds nothing
//! in the old buckets and asks for nothing. A row the shell could not move keeps
//! the address it has, which still opens, and is offered again next launch — a
//! migration that gave up on a locked file permanently would strand a book in a
//! bucket for one busy moment.
//!
//! Two ordering rules, both load-bearing:
//!
//!   * it runs BEFORE the startup measurement pass. A move changes the address a
//!     row holds, and measuring the old one would mark the book `missing` for a
//!     file this pass is about to put somewhere else;
//!   * it leaves the copy's modification time alone. A stored row's identity is
//!     the measurement of its OWN bytes, and every ledger entry, tombstone and
//!     `placed` fingerprint names that measurement — re-stamping on a migration
//!     would change a fingerprint the folder ledgers still hold, and turn every
//!     stored book into a file its own folder has never seen.
