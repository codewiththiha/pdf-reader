//! The frontend half of the library's filesystem wire.
//!
//! This file is the phone line and nothing else:
//!
//!   * [`install_import_bridge`] — ONE Tauri listener for the app's life, which
//!     re-broadcasts the shell's progress beats as a window
//!     [`IMPORT_PROGRESS_EVENT`]. Same shape as `services::ai`'s chunk bridge
//!     and for the same reason: a per-mount listener would stack handlers whose
//!     closures die with their owner, and the import dock mounts and unmounts
//!     with the page.
//!   * the `invoke` wrappers — one per shell command, each turning a typed
//!     request into the wire types `library_core::wire` declares and parsing the
//!     answer back. Nothing above this module ever sees a `JsValue`.
//!   * the two native pickers, filtered to the format registry's own extension
//!     list.
//!
//! ## The verb convention
//!
//! A function that splits a batch into the half that may land now and the
//! half that owes a question is a `screen_*` — [`conflict::screen`], the
//! shelf-move departure's screen, the import's merge screen. The answer is
//! always a `(clean, asked)` pair, and the asked half always goes to a sheet
//! rather than being dropped: a screen that silently discarded its second
//! half is the vanishing placement the sheets exist to stop.
//!
//! The deciding is NOT here. Which files a scan adds, where they land and what
//! a rescan skips is `library_core`'s ledger; [`import`] runs it against the
//! shell's answers and writes the result to the library state, [`arrange`]
//! holds the moves a reader makes by hand (a drag between shelves, a shelf filed
//! inside another, a removal, a relink), and [`conflict`] is the one question
//! both ask before a placement lands: does the level this is going to already
//! hold a book of this name? The rule itself is `library_core::conflict`'s —
//! pure, and host-tested — and [`conflict`] is the wiring between it and the
//! three answers the sheet offers.
//!
