//! The shelf's "Duplicate": a second instance of one thing, asked for by name.
//!
//! A duplicate is the app's own object from the moment it exists, so a BOOK
//! always duplicates into the library's own store — never into the folder the
//! original reads from, whatever its origin. The store's own batch names the
//! copy after the row's new id, stamps it with its own modification time, and
//! answers with the copy's own measurement, so the row is known by that
//! measurement from the first moment; the source the original recorded stays the
//! provenance both wear.
//!
//! A read-at-place book used to duplicate as a second FILE beside the first, on
//! the reader's own disk. That sibling was still linked, so a later move off its
//! folder's shelf copied it AGAIN into the store and left the first copy
//! orphaned on disk, owned by nothing and invisible to the library. Copying
//! straight into the store removes the sibling, the orphan and the second
//! conversion at once: the duplicate was never linked, so the departure rule
//! never sees it.
//!
//! Either way the duplicate is a row of its own in the persisted ledger: its
//! own id, its own name — the level's counter, the conflict sheet's own
//! convention — its own resume point and highlights, and no memory of the
//! reader's place in the original. It is filed where the original is filed,
//! every shelf of it, right behind the row the reader pointed at: a duplicate
//! that landed somewhere else would be a book the reader has to go and find.
//!
//! A link duplicates as a link: a pointer is a row like any other, and the
//! second pointer costs no bytes. A book whose address died has nothing to
//! copy and says so by not being offered (the menu's `missing` rule, which is
//! the Open row's own).
//!
//! A SHELF duplicates as a shelf, and is the other answer rather than a batch
//! of book duplicates: a shelf holds membership and never held a byte, so its
//! duplicate is a second shelf of the reader's own holding the same books, with
//! the whole tree inside it copied along (`duplicate_shelf_row`). The
//! right-click lands on both kinds and the selection holds both, so one door
//! answers for both and the report counts them by kind.
