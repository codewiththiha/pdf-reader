//! The open handshake both pipelines share.
//!
//! A PDF and a reflowable document are opened by different tails — one waits
//! on the engine, the other on a file read and a parser — but they end in the
//! same place: the same identity fields written, the same gloss marks loaded,
//! the same resume clamp, startup scale, route flip and shelf record. Those
//! steps live here once.
//!
//! A contract, not a convenience: the tails used to spell the handshake out
//! separately and drifted — loading gloss marks at open (so the first painted
//! page carries them) was added to the PDF seed and had to be added to the
//! reflow tail by hand. A step added here reaches every format at once.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT here: the order in which a tail seeds its own content.
//! Both tails depend on an order only they can see — heights published at the
//! seed scale, the anchor guard up before the page is written, the route
//! flipping last — and a shared function would hide the sequence that makes it
//! correct.
