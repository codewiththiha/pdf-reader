//! The library's record of the book that was just opened.

//! The last step of both open tails, and the only place the reader's own progress

//! point is allowed to be — is `library_core::book::record_read` and its
//! row-addressed `library_core::book::record_read_row`; this is the wiring to the
//! signals and the save.
