//! Opening a reflowable document — plain text, Markdown, and whatever joins
//! them later.
//!
//! The shape mirrors the PDF open (claim the session, read, seed, flip the
//! status), but the content never touches the pdf.js engine: the file is read
//! through the shell's `read_file_text` command and handed to its format's
//! parser, which returns the blocks the shared machinery lays out. From here on
//! a text document and a PDF are the same object — pages of the same A4 sheet,
//! the same scale pipeline, the same strip, the same virtualizer — and the one
//! difference is what paints inside a page (see `components::formats::reflow`).
//!
//! Two things make this the whole format-specific surface of the open flow:
//!
//! * the PARSER is a match on the format, not a second pipeline. A third
//!   reflowable format adds one arm here (and a block view, and a renderer);
//!   it does not copy this file.
//! * pagination starts from the pure estimate — character counts against the
//!   column width — so the reader is up the instant the file is read. The measure
//!   column then replaces the estimate with the DOM's real heights and re-cuts
//!   once (see `components::formats::reflow::measure`).
//!
//! Markdown also gets an outline, and it is seeded rather than resolved: the
//! headings are already in the text, so this file hands the reader the block
//! indices and `effects::reader::reflow_outline` turns them into pages against the
//! live cut. There is no `outline::resolve` tail to race, which is why
//! `outline_pending` goes false here.
