//! [`ZoomController`]: the single authority for what the effective zoom is
//! and how every change of it runs.
//!
//! All zoom traffic arrives as commands on `viewer.zoom.commands` — toolbar
//! buttons, keyboard steps, the fit watcher, the follow watcher — and is
//! executed by exactly one effect here. The controller:
//!
//! 1. resolves the command to a target (fit and constraint maths live in
//!    super::target),
//! 2. opens a transition from the scale on screen right now to that target,
//! 3. tweens the live display scale (super::animation), relaying the layout
//!    out through the engine on every frame so the document resizes
//!    continuously under the reader's eyes,
//! 4. and on landing brings the render scale onto the target and releases
//!    the freezes (render suspension, page/scroll synchronisation, geometry
//!    feedback, scroll echo).
//!
//! A container follow (`ZoomCommand::Follow`, one post per frame of a sidebar
//! slide or a window drag) is the one command that does not commit when it
//! lands. Its layout must move every frame or the page squishes, but a raster
//! pass per frame would be a storm, so the transition stays open — holding the
//! same freezes a gesture holds — and a deadline `FOLLOW_SETTLE_MS` after the
//! burst goes quiet commits it once. Every post moves the deadline, so what the
//! reader sees is a page that rides the slide and sharpens when it stops.
//!
//! Around the transaction, the strips' zombie retention grace is raised so
//! pages a moving window evicts keep their DOM (and their last bitmap)
//! briefly — the bridge that keeps the zoom from popping pages out.
//!
//! Because the controller is created with the reader page and lives exactly
//! as long as its reactive owner, there is no global registry to leak or
//! race: the old thread-local `CUR_ZOOM` registration is gone, and the
//! free-function `request_zoom` entry points with it.
