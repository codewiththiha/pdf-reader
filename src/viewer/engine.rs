//! [`ViewerEngine`]: the single owner of the virtualized scroll geometry.
//!
//! The core contract is that the engine is the *only* place layout is
//! rescaled. Zoom and fit compute a *target* and ask the engine to apply a
//! scale factor; the engine owns the relayout so a gesture and a refit
//! cannot diverge along separate code paths. Non-rescale geometry reads
//! (dominant page, scroll-to-page) still go through the virtualizers
//! directly, but only in the per-mode navigation code.
//!
//! It runs on EVERY frame of a zoom: the tween hands it the ratio between
//! the scale it is about to show and the scale the layout currently has, and
//! the layout follows continuously. Scaling the layout for real is what
//! keeps a zoom stable. The alternative — one CSS transform over a surface
//! whose geometry is frozen — cannot work here, because a transform scales
//! the page gaps along with the pages while the layout deliberately does
//! not (see `virtual_list::anchor::rescale_anchor`). Every gap above the
//! reader accumulates error through the tween and the whole sum lands at
//! once when the transform is swapped for real geometry, which reads as the
//! document jumping.
//!
//! Anchoring is therefore explicit and gap-aware: the engine works out which
//! document point sits under the viewport centre, rescales, finds where that
//! same point lands in the new geometry, and puts it back under the viewport
//! centre. Page interiors scale; the fixed gap between pages does not.
//!
//! Because this runs every frame, the anchored page is resolved in `O(log n)`
//! from the strip's own prefix sums (`index_at`) and the column is never
//! copied: the anchor reads the pre-scale store once, the store is then scaled
//! in place, and the strip rebuild reads the now-scaled values. The anchor
//! cannot be left to the virtualizer either — that one scales item extents,
//! and the strips fold the page gap *into* the item size (their `gap` is `0.0`
//! and `report_size` is handed `height + gap`), so a uniform rescale there
//! scales the chrome too. Nor can the scroll write be deferred a frame: layout
//! and scroll have to move in the same tick.
