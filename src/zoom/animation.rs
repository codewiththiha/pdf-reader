//! The zoom tween.
//!
//! Every animation frame does exactly one thing: work out the scale the eye
//! should be at, and hand the actuator the ratio between that scale and the
//! scale the layout currently has. The actuator rescales the strips and holds
//! the document point under the viewport centre exactly where it is, while
//! the page hosts stretch the bitmap they already hold to the new size — so
//! the reader watches the paper itself change size, with nothing to capture
//! before the gesture and nothing to restore after it.
//!
//! The layout is what animates, on purpose. Scaling a frozen surface with one
//! CSS transform instead looks stable while it runs and jumps at the end: a
//! transform scales the page gaps along with the pages, and the layout
//! deliberately does not, so every gap above the reader accumulates error
//! through the tween and the whole sum lands at once at the commit.
//!
//! The paginated modes have no strip to rescale; for them the frame just
//! moves the display scale and the single mounted host stretches to it.
//!
//! The interpolation is an out-cubic, which is what the smooth zoom has
//! always felt like: it covers ground early and decelerates into the target
//! instead of stopping dead on it.
//!
//! The loop reads the live `zoom.transition` signal each frame, so a
//! retarget mid-flight (a burst of `+` presses, a sidebar still sliding) is
//! adopted seamlessly: the tween continues from wherever the eye currently
//! is towards the new target, on a restarted clock.
//!
//! A container follow does not normally come through this loop: its target is
//! whatever the container allows RIGHT NOW, so the controller lands it in the
//! very frame the new size was reported and holds the commit for the end of the
//! burst. Easing towards a moving target would have the page visibly chasing
//! the window — covering a fraction of each new gap per frame and never quite
//! arriving. The loop can still be handed one (a follow taking over while a
//! tween is already running), so it knows how to land it without committing it.
