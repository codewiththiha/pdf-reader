//! The app-root effects, installed once and in the one order that works.
//!
//! These used to be a bare run of calls in `App` with the ordering contract in
//! comments beside them — nothing enforced it, and two of the steps are
//! order-dependent in ways that fail silently. One entry point gives the
//! contract a home.
//!
//! THE ORDER, and why each step is where it is:
//!
//! 1. `apply_theme` + `apply_typography` — both page kinds paint from the
//!    custom properties these write, so they must be on `<html>` before the
//!    first frame; late, the reader flashes the untinted palette (or a text
//!    document the default type).
//! 2. `paper_settings` — the paper session's blend and detection settings must
//!    land before the FIRST document opens: the open flow asks the engine's
//!    per-document colour cache under the reader's real settings, earlier than
//!    any reader mounts. Asked under defaults, the first book's backdrop is
//!    quietly the wrong colour.
//! 3. `publish_motion` — the reduced-motion projection, needed by the reader's
//!    pipeline and by CSS the app does not model.
//! 4. The input and selection arms, in any order among themselves.
//! 5. The app-lifetime Tauri listeners, in any order between them:
//!    `install_ai_chunk_bridge` (AI chunks), `install_import_bridge` (the
//!    library's progress beats) and `install_window_state_bridge` (the
//!    frameless maximize flag). Then `library_watch`, which measures every
//!    address the library holds and rescans the watched folders once it has —
//!    before the OS handoff below, so a double-clicked book never lands in the
//!    middle of that first pass.
//! 6. `init_open_file_handling` — LAST, and the step the ordering is really
//!    for: it can open a document IMMEDIATELY (a double-clicked file hands the
//!    backend a path before the webview finishes mounting), so every step
//!    above must have run by then.
//!
//! INSTALLED ONCE. Each arm registers a window listener, a Tauri subscription,
//! or both, and none unsubscribe — they live as long as the app. That is wrong
//! for a second mount (hot reload, hydration retry), where listeners would
//! stack and every keystroke be handled twice; the guard below makes the
//! second install a no-op.
