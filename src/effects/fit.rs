//! Fit-mode effect: recomputes the render scale while FitMode::Width or
//! FitMode::Page is active. Runs once from the app root (ReaderView) so fit
//! works in BOTH the single and continuous views, whichever is mounted.
//!
//! Reactively tracks `fit`, `container_size`, and `page1_size`; when a fit mode
//! is active it computes the matching scale and writes `viewer.scale` +
//! `viewer.render_scale`. `scale` is read untracked so the write-back does not
//! retrigger this effect (no loop).
//!
//! The scale write is DEBOUNCED: the sidebar `<aside>` animates its width over
//! 300ms, emitting a burst of `container_size` writes, and an immediate
//! recompute per frame would cancel every in-flight render (`PageCanvas`
//! re-renders on a scale change), flashing the visible pages. Scheduling the
//! recompute 120ms after the size has been stable yields exactly one re-render
//! per sidebar toggle, at the end of the slide. `container_size` itself stays
//! live — page tracking and the visible-page math still need it — only the
//! scale write is debounced. Changes that leave the fit scale essentially
//! unchanged are skipped: if the recomputed scale is within `0.0005` of the
//! current `render_scale`, the write is a no-op and does not force a
//! full re-render of every `PageCanvas`.
//!
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! This module also owns the ZOOM COORDINATOR (`request_zoom` / `zoom_system`).
//!
//! The rule that makes zoom feel like Preview: **a zoom is a layout animation
//! of bitmaps we have already painted, followed by ONE crisp re-render** — it
//! is never a render-driven relayout.
//!
//! What used to happen: a control wrote `scale` and `render_scale` at the same
//! instant. Every mounted `PageCanvas` cancelled its bitmap and started
//! rasterising; page wrappers kept their OLD `top:` and the spacer its OLD
//! height until each render resolved and reported geometry back. So for a few
//! frames the column was laid out at the old scale with new-scale pages landing
//! in it one by one, and the scroll offset — untouched — pointed at a
//! completely different page by the time it settled. That is the "zoom jumps to
//! another page" bug, and the intermediate states are the flicker.
//!
//! What happens now, per gesture:
//!   1. `request_zoom` posts `(target, animate, token)`. Controls never write
//!      `scale`/`render_scale` themselves.
//!   2. `zoom_system` drives `display_scale` over `ZOOM_ANIM_MS` on rAF. Each
//!      frame it rescales `doc.page_heights` by the frame's factor and
//!      re-anchors `scroll_top` with `anchored_scroll`, so layout and scroll
//!      move together, in the same frame, and the point under the viewport
//!      centre never moves. Pages CSS-stretch; nothing renders.
//!   3. On settle it writes `scale` + `render_scale` once and drops
//!      `zoom_animating`, releasing exactly one crisp render pass.
//!
//! Retargeting is first-class: a new request mid-flight re-aims from wherever
//! the animation currently is (mashing `+` accelerates smoothly instead of
//! queueing). The token guards against a stale frame resurrecting a cancelled
//! animation. `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses the animation to a single
//! anchored step — still anchored, just instant.
