//! Paints the reflowable formats' typography onto `<html>` whenever it
//! changes — the text counterpart of `apply_theme`.
//!
//! The contract comes from `text_core::typography::css_variables`: every
//! knob the settings own is written as a SCALE-1 custom property
//! (`--tx-font-size`, `--tx-line-height`, …). The page hosts never read the
//! settings for type — they set their own `--ts` multiplier and let the
//! stylesheet resolve `calc(var(--tx-…) * var(--ts))`. That split is why a
//! zoom never repaints typography (only `--ts` moves) and why a settings
//! change repaints everywhere at once, pages and the measure column alike.
