//! Continuous-scroll effect: maps container scroll -> viewer.scroll_top.
//! OWNED BY branch A (viewer/continuous).
//!
//! Runs once when the continuous view mounts. Attaches a scroll listener to
//! `#page-list` and writes `viewer.scroll_top` whenever the container offset
//! moves by >= 0.5px (a cheap rAF-style throttle — Leptos signals only notify
//! on actual value change, so this just avoids redundant JS->Rust calls).
//! The listener is removed when the view unmounts.
//!
//! NO POINTERDOWN FOCUS STEALER. The previous version attached a pointerdown
//! listener on `#page-list` that called `el.focus()` on every click inside the
//! scroller. This interrupted the browser's selection initialization: when the
//! reader clicked-and-dragged to select text, the focus steal fired on
//! pointerdown, stealing focus from the text-layer span the click started on,
//! and the browser's drag-selection tracking was disrupted — multi-page
//! selection was discontinuous and jumpy. Removing the pointerdown listener
//! lets the browser own selection initialization; keyboard focus recovery on
//! virtualization unmount (focusout) is also removed because it caused the same
//! class of interference.
