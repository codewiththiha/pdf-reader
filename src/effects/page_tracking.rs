//! Page-tracking: keeps `viewer.page` and the continuous scroll position in
//! sync so the status-bar counter follows scrolling and page jumps (nav,
//! thumbnails, outline, search) actually move the scrollport in continuous
//! mode.
//!
//! Wired once from ReaderPage (like `fit_effect`). All effects are no-ops
//! outside continuous mode:
//!   1. mode-flip — entering continuous mode aligns `scroll_top` to the current
//!      page. `viewer.page` is the source of truth here, NOT the stale offset
//!      left over from a previous continuous session.
//!   2. scroll->page — scrolling derives the DOMINANT page (the one filling
//!      most of the viewport) and writes `viewer.page`. This also reacts to
//!      height changes (zoom, lazy render fills), so the counter tracks
//!      whichever page the current offset now shows. It deliberately does NOT
//!      use the top-edge page: zooming out slides more of the previous page
//!      into the top of the viewport, which walked the counter (1 -> 2 -> 3...)
//!      while the reader was in fact holding perfectly still.
//!   3. page->scroll — an explicit page jump scrolls the `scroll_top` signal AND
//!      the actual `#page-list` DOM to the page top when they disagree, rounded
//!      UP so a fractional page top is crossed (an `as i32` floor would land
//!      short and the counter would read the previous page). If page heights
//!      aren't measured yet (first continuous session), it falls back to the
//!      same uniform estimate PageList uses to seed heights.
//!   4. exact-landing — the effect-3 target is placeholder-based and can drift
//!      for documents with varied page sizes, and a layout change (e.g. closing
//!      the sidebar mid-jump) can move the page while we're landing on it. This
//!      re-aims the scroll at the target page until scroll matches its exact
//!      rendered top (`cont-{P-1}-wrap` offsetTop), riding out both drift and
//!      the scale race. While the wrapper isn't mounted yet it aims at a fresh
//!      height-estimate so the page comes into view and mounts. It abandons only
//!      when the USER scrolls — the scroll signal diverging from the last value
//!      effects 3/4 wrote — never on distance alone.
//!
//! The two one-way syncs share a suppression flag: effect 2 sets it just before
//! writing `page`, effect 3 clears it on its next run. That is what stops them
//! from ping-ponging — effect 2 only fires on scroll/height changes, effect 3
//! only on page/mode changes, so the dependency sets never form a cycle.
//!
//! CRITICAL Leptos gotcha: effects only subscribe to signals they READ during a
//! run, so effects 3/4 read `page`/`mode`/`scroll_top`/`heights` unconditionally
//! at the top — a conditional read would silently drop a subscription the first
//! time a branch was skipped, and the effect would never fire again.
