//! The zoom sources: thin reactive watchers that re-ask the zoom controller
//! when the world under the reader changes.
//!
//! Neither watcher computes a scale, writes a zoom signal, or calls the
//! engine — they POST COMMANDS ([`ZoomCommand`]) and the controller's one
//! transition pipeline does the rest. The one question either asks back is
//! `posting_gate`: whether a transaction is already open that it must not
//! disturb, and whether the burst it is holding should carry this change too.
//! That is a gate on posting, not a share of the maths. It is the whole point of
//! the split: fit width, fit page, a sidebar slide, a window resize and a manual
//! `+` all land through the same resolve → relayout → commit path, so they can no
//! longer race along separate code paths.
//!
//! What the two watchers differ in is CADENCE, which is the whole difference
//! between a page that rides a resize and a page that waits for one:
//!
//! - `follow_watcher`: the SPACE the page has moved — a sidebar slide or a
//!   window drag, both of which report a burst of container sizes. It fires on
//!   every frame of that burst, because a scale frozen through it leaves the
//!   page host wider than the box it now has to fit in, and the flex engine
//!   squishes the paper (a letter page went from a 0.77 aspect to 0.58) until
//!   the refit finally lands. Only the crisp RENDER waits: a follow holds its
//!   commit until the container has been quiet, so a slide costs one raster
//!   pass instead of one per frame.
//!
//!   Which of the two bursts is running decides which switch in the Animations
//!   tab owns it (the viewport width moves on a window drag and not on a rail
//!   slide, which is the tell). Whichever one is off, the follow does not stop
//!   happening — it stops being animated: the frames are dropped and the end
//!   frame lands in one step once the burst goes quiet.
//! - `fit_watcher`: the world under the scale changed in a way that is not a
//!   burst — a view-mode flip, a new document, and (only while the Auto Resize
//!   setting is on) a page turn in a mixed-size book. Single events, so they
//!   debounce and land through the ordinary transition, and a page-only change
//!   must NOT follow the layout per frame:
//!   scrolling through a book of alternating sizes would re-fit at every row
//!   boundary. It posts the fit when a fit owns the scale and the
//!   shrink-to-fit ceiling when the reader zoomed by hand, so neither case is
//!   left stale against the page under the eyes. Choosing or dropping a fit is
//!   the one event it does not postpone: that is a click, and a click answers
//!   in the frame it lands. With Auto Resize off the page dependency is not
//!   even subscribed, so a page turn cannot reach this watcher at all.
//!
//! Both fires are deliberately UNTWEENED. A refit that tracks a live resize has
//! to land in the frame it was asked for; queueing a 120ms animation against
//! each new width had the page visibly chasing the window. Manual zooms keep
//! their tween — they are one gesture, not a stream.
