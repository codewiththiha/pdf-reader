//! The zoom coordinator: a zoom is a layout animation of bitmaps we already
//! painted, followed by ONE crisp re-render. `request_zoom` posts
//! `(target, animate, token)`; `zoom_system` drives `display_scale` on rAF,
//! re-scaling `page_heights` and re-anchoring `scroll_top` each frame; on
//! settle it writes `scale` + `render_scale` once. Retargeting is
//! first-class (mashing `+` re-aims from wherever the animation is), and
//! `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses the animation to a single anchored step.
//!
//! Split out of `fit.rs`: fit (`fit_effect`) and zoom are two systems sharing
//! a small hand-off (`commit_scale` / `gesture_owns_layout` /
//! `take_commit_echo`).
