//! The held-write gate.
//!
//! Decides whether a run of the page→scroll effect may command the strip, in
//! a form pure enough to unit-test on the host.
//!
//! The two inputs it distinguishes are "the page signal changed" and "the
//! zoom transaction flag changed" — the effect re-runs for both, and only the
//! first is a navigation intent. A write that lands while a transaction holds
//! the geometry is HELD, with its value; the first run after the transaction
//! closes replays it. A transaction that closes with no held write moves
//! nothing, which is what keeps a zoom commit from scrolling the top of the
//! current page back under the reader's eyes.
//!
//! Holding the VALUE (not just a flag) is what lets the replay survive the
//! dominant arm: both effects re-run in the same flush when a transaction
//! closes, and if the dominant arm runs first it reads the not-yet-jumped
//! strip and "corrects" the page back to the stale dominant item — a replay
//! that only remembered "something was held" would then scroll to the
//! clobbered page. So the dominant arm DEFERS to [`JumpGate::pending`] for
//! exactly that flush, and a replay whose page signal was clobbered anyway
//! RE-ASSERTS the held page alongside the scroll.
