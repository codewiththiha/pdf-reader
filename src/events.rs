//! The app's window-`CustomEvent` protocol: every event name in one table,
//! plus the one typed dispatcher.
//!
//! Window CustomEvents are the app's cross-cutting message mechanism — they
//! cross layer boundaries (services → components, engine JS → Rust) without
//! either side holding a signal from the other. Three of these names are also
//! a protocol with the imperative engine, which dispatches
//! `pdfreader:navigate`, `pdfreader:selection-pages` and
//! `pdfreader:selection-detail` from plain JS and declares them in
//! `public/engine/events.ts`. `tools/check-events.ts` fails CI when the two
//! tables disagree or when a name is spelled as a literal elsewhere — a
//! mismatch is not a compile error on either side, only a dispatch into a
//! window nobody is listening on.
