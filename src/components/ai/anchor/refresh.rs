/// The typography is deliberately NOT read here. Every knob that moves type
/// moves the cut (the measure column re-publishes it), so the cut's generation

/// dial, the column's alignment) cannot move a mark either. Reading settings
/// instead would re-derive every stroke on a colour change for nothing.

/// notifies only when the value differs, so a re-measure that re-cut nothing
/// costs one hash and wakes nobody.
///
/// The cut enters it as its GENERATION counter, not as its contents. This
/// derive re-runs on every scroll frame of a reflowable document (the stroke
/// layer reads it through [`layer_refresh`], which tracks scroll), and hashing
/// the split meant walking every page boundary of the open book once per frame
/// — hundreds of them in a long novel, to conclude, on almost every frame, that
/// nothing had moved. One counter read says the same thing. The counter's
/// granularity is coarser by design: it bumps on a re-publish that changed
/// nothing, and the cost of that is one wake of the consumers, which is less
/// than the hash it replaced.
