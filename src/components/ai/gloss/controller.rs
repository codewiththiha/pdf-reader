//! The gloss state-machine hub. The controller groups its twenty-odd signals
//! into cohesive slices — [`GlossContent`] (what the model is doing),
//! [`GlossGeometry`] (what the card's box is doing), [`GlossOpen`] (which
//! mark the card belongs to), [`GlossDrag`] (pointer state) and
//! [`GlossCache`] (session answers) — so a hook that needs one concern takes
//! one slice instead of the whole flat field list, and the shared behaviours
//! ([`GlossCommands`]: reset, collapse, mark persistence, retry) are clearly
//! commands rather than more state.
//!
//! The open path is a named state machine: [`open_verdict`] decides what a
//! request means given the controller's state (stale flag / swallow /
//! collapse / open), and the open effect only dispatches on that verdict —
//! no five-deep early-return chain. [`begin_open`], [`serve_cached`] and
//! [`begin_fetch`] are the three transitions that actually move state.
//!
//! Open requests are deterministic: both the Info pill and a saved stroke
//! dispatch `pdfreader:gloss-open` with the mark in the event detail. The
//! listener ([`use_open_listener`]) sets `pending` and bumps `request`
//! (which the open effect tracks), so the effect always runs with a mark in
//! hand — never a race against `detail` being cleared or a stale
//! `popover_open = true` no-op.
