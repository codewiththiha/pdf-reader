//! The two phase machines of the word card: what its BOX is doing
//! ([`GlossPhase`]) and what its DATA is doing ([`AiPhase`]).
//!
//! They lived in `components/ai/types.rs`, a file whose own doc had to explain
//! that the wire types were no longer in it and were only re-exported "so the
//! existing import paths keep resolving". Both enums are read exclusively by
//! this module — the card's geometry, its content, the chunk hook and the
//! surface that composes them — and neither is a wire type, so they belong here
//! with their only consumers, and the wire types are imported from
//! `ai_core::types` directly. That is what deleted the shim: nothing was left
//! in it that was not either someone else's type or these two.
//!
//! The two are deliberately orthogonal. A card can be streaming text while its
//! box is still sprung open, or folded back onto the stroke while the answer it
//! shows is complete; conflating them is what would make the morph and the
//! stream fight over one state.
