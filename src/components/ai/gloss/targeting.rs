//! Card targeting: everything that decides where the sprung box wants to be
//! right now — the page-aware anchor watch, the reactive viewport, the
//! content-height measurement, the expanded and spring targets, the spring
//! itself, and the morph progress derived from all of them.
//!
//! Extracted from the popover's wiring so the composition root reads as
//! controller → targeting → lifecycle hooks → view, and so the pieces that
//! need to coordinate (the open effect re-anchors the spring; the settle
//! watcher reads the anchor and the sprung box) share one named bundle
//! instead of twelve loose locals.
