//! Where a reflowable gloss mark lives, and how its pixels are found again.
//!
//! A PDF mark stores a rect against a page host and is done: the page is fixed
//! pixels, so the rect is the identity. A plain-text or Markdown document has
//! no such fixed grid — a font-size change, a window resize, the measure column
//! settling onto real heights, all of them re-cut the pages — so a page-space
//! rect would drift onto whatever text moved under it. The identity that
//! survives every re-flow is the BLOCK the words sit in and how far into that
//! block's rendered text they start ([`ReflowSpot`]).
//!
//! This module owns the two halves of that deal:
//!
//! * the ENVELOPE — a spot, and the sentence that was around it, serialized
//!   into [`GlossMark::context`] behind a version tag, so the persisted schema
//!   stays the one `PageAnchor` shape and a PDF's plain-sentence context can
//!   never be mistaken for a spot;
//! * the PROJECTION — `block + [start, end)` back to viewport pixels, by
//!   asking the DOM: block → the row element rendering it (by id, and in the
//!   paginated modes only if that row is mounted under its page's host), then a
//!   real `Range` over the row's text nodes.
//!
//! Projection is deliberately never cached. It runs on the watcher's frame and
//! on the stroke layer's memo, both of which already re-run for scroll and
//! zoom, and a cached rect is exactly the thing a re-flow invalidates. The
//! ENVELOPE is the opposite case: it is persisted content that only ever
//! changes by being replaced, and it is re-read on every one of those frames,
//! so its parse is memoized ([`parse_spot`]) against the string it came from.
//!
//! The walk itself — a block's text nodes, the character offsets that address
//! them, and the `Range` a span becomes — is shared with everything else that
//! paints over a reflowable document's type, and lives in
//! [`crate::components::formats::reflow::spot`]. What stays here is the mark's
//! own arithmetic: [`union_box`] (client rects → one stroke box) and the
//! envelope above it.
