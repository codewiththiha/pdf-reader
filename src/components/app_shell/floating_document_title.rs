//! Difference-blend floating document name, parked TOP-LEFT.
//!
//! Overlap policy: the label may sit over the page canvas, but may cover at
//! most `MAX_CANVAS_OVERLAP` of the canvas width. Its budget is the blank gap
//! left of the page plus that overlap allowance (minus a safety margin); the
//! name shows in full only when its NATURAL width fits that budget, otherwise
//! it disappears entirely — it never truncates over the page.
//!
//! Shown only when a document is open, the sidebar is OFF (its identity row
//! already shows the name) AND the titlebar is not visible (the bar contains
//! the name).
//!
//! Blend contract: `mix-blend-difference` blends only against what is painted
//! *inside the element's isolation group* (its nearest ancestor stacking
//! context). The shell subtree creates such contexts freely (toolbar glass
//! `backdrop-filter`, `opacity` fades, z-token wrappers, `prop:inert`
//! toggling), and whenever the group happened to exclude the pages the
//! backdrop read transparent — `white difference transparent = white` — with
//! the blend snapping back only when an unrelated animation forced the
//! compositor to re-invalidate the layer. So the label is PORTALED to
//! `<body>` and `position: fixed`: its only ancestors are body/html, its
//! isolation group is the root canvas group, and that group always contains
//! the pages' pixels — deterministic, with no ancestor able to isolate it.
//!
//! Rules that keep it working forever:
//! 1. `mix-blend-difference` must sit on the SAME element that is
//!    `position: fixed`. `fixed` creates a stacking context, so a fixed
//!    wrapper around a blended child isolates the child against a transparent
//!    backdrop (`white difference transparent = white`) — that exact shape is
//!    what made the portaled label read white in the browser.
//! 2. The blending node and its ancestors up to `<body>` must otherwise stay
//!    stacking-context-FREE: no z-index, opacity, transform, filter,
//!    backdrop-filter, isolation, contain or will-change. Above/below is
//!    solved with DOM order, never z-index.
//! 3. The fade (`opacity-0`) stays on the inner span, a DESCENDANT of the
//!    blending node: a descendant's opacity never isolates the blend.
//!    Mid-fade the text simply fades; the blend stays live.
//! 4. If it ever reads white again: DevTools → blending node → walk the
//!    ancestors to `<body>` and look for the properties in rule 2, and make
//!    sure no `position: fixed|sticky` or stacking-context ancestor sits
//!    BETWEEN the blend and `<body>` other than the blending node itself.
