//! Base mode + colour tint — the two controls that replaced the six fixed
//! themes.
//!
//! The base is a 3-way segmented choice (Light / Dark / Dim) because they are
//! mutually exclusive structural options, not a list that will grow. The tint
//! below it is hue + strength, and it is deliberately shown even at strength 0
//! rather than hidden behind a "enable tint" toggle: a control that appears
//! and disappears is harder to find than one that is simply at zero.
