//! The 🎨 Appearance popover: presets, base mode + tint, texture, film grain.
//!
//! Dismissal rules (owned by the shared window-aware `Popover`):
//! - Outside-click and Escape close it.
//! - Exclusivity with every other floating surface is NOT a side effect of that
//!   outside press. It used to be — a press on another toolbar trigger landed
//!   outside this root, so this popover closed and then the other opened — and
//!   that story only ever held menu-to-menu: a modal is not a press target, and
//!   a trigger under a modal's backdrop is still clickable, so this menu and the
//!   settings modal could end up open at once. `MenuPopover` now registers this
//!   popover's open signal with the overlay board
//!   ([`crate::components::primitives::overlay::lanes`]) as
//!   [`OverlayPolicy::MENU`][crate::components::primitives::overlay::lanes::OverlayPolicy],
//!   and the board evicts whichever surface loses. Nothing here does that work.
//! - NOTHING inside closes it. The old menu closed on theme selection, which
//!   made sense when a theme was one click and you were done. It is actively
//!   wrong now: choosing a preset and then nudging its tint is the normal
//!   workflow, and a popover that vanished on the first click would make that
//!   impossible. Every control here is live-preview, so staying open IS the
//!   feedback loop.
//!
//! The panel scrolls and is clamped/flipped by the Popover, so it can never
//! overflow off-screen.
//!
//! ## Which sections show is a question about the surface
//!
//! Not every knob paints anything on every route, and a section that changes
//! something no pixel on screen reads is a section the reader has to read and
//! then ignore. So the menu is told WHICH surface mounted it
//! ([`ChromeSurface`], the shell controller's name for the route) and gates
//! the one section that is a document's business — page texture paints the
//! PDF's paper bitmaps, so it shows on the reader surface and only while a
//! raster document is the one open: the same two facts the settings modal's
//! Paper section gates itself on (`crate::components::settings::paper`). The
//! shelf has no page to texture; a reflowable document paints its paper from
//! the theme tokens. Mode, tint, presets and grain are the window's own and
//! show everywhere.
