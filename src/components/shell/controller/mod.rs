//! The shell's single source of truth for layout state.
//!
//! "Is the rail overlay or docked?", "does the bar owe the traffic lights a
//! gutter?", "may the sidebar toggle show?", "is the rail painted right now?"
//! used to be recomputed wherever they were needed — the page derived
//! `overlay_sb` per mount point, `app_title_bar.rs` rebuilt `rail_painted` /
//! `band_inset` / `lights_gutter` / `bar_gutter` from a chrome context, the
//! floating label carried its own fallback. Changing one rule meant finding
//! every spelling of it.
//!
//! Now the page builds ONE [`ShellController`] and provides it as context;
//! components ask instead of recomputing:
//!
//! ```text
//! let shell = use_context::<ShellController>().expect(...);
//! shell.is_overlay().get()      // rail floats over the page?
//! shell.rail_present().get()    // rail on screen, close motion included?
//! shell.titlebar_left_gutter()  // px the bar's row insets for the lights
//! ```
//!
//! The controller also OWNS the open/close bookkeeping and the remembered last
//! panel, so "reopen what was open" is one call (`open_last_panel`).
//!
//! THE CLOSE MACHINE, TWO GEOMETRIES. The layouts do not share a motion: the
//! DOCKED rail slides (the aside tweens its width over [`SIDEBAR_SLIDE_MS`]);
//! the FLOATING rail fades over [`SIDEBAR_FADE_MS`] — a transform slide off
//! the window edge would travel under the native traffic lights, which can
//! only appear and disappear. Chrome must stay aligned with the pixels for the
//! whole motion: the raw mode flips to `None` on the close click, before the
//! rail is out of the way, so `rail_present` means "open OR the close animation
//! is still running" — and whatever yields to the rail (the bar's band inset,
//! the lights' host, the floating label's corner) derives from it, releasing
//! when the motion lands, not on frame one.
//!
//! OPEN mounts thumbnail cells immediately so warm bitmaps paint while the rail
//! moves; `panel_intro` is the DOCKED open's paint-only marker (a two-frame
//! flag starting the panel opacity transition without delaying the cell DOM),
//! skipped in overlay where the wrapper's own fade is the reveal. CLOSE is the
//! only timer-gated direction: it keeps the last panel painted through the
//! motion (`collapsing`) and releases the live thumbnail canvases the instant
//! the motion lands — one timer waiting out whichever duration the layout's
//! rail runs, so a reopen inside that window never unmounts, re-renders or
//! reallocates. Settings → Animations can freeze the motion (`no_slide`): the
//! docked rail jumps to its end width, the floating rail appears at full
//! opacity, and the close hold releases on the spot.
//!
//! THE ANSWERS ARE PURE: every question is decided by a rule in [`rules`] —
//! mode, collapsing flag and last panel in, a bool out, no signal and no owner
//! — which is why the cases that matter (a close caught mid-slide, a tab
//! switch, a reopen before the cells mounted) are tests there, not prose here.
//!
//! TWO PAGES, ONE RULEBOOK. The reader builds the controller with
//! [`ShellController::reader`] (rail + titlebar); the library with
//! [`ShellController::titlebar_only`], which answers every rail question "no
//! rail" — the bar keeps the full window width, its 88px gutter and its
//! lights. The no-rail answers stay in the same rulebook instead of an
//! `Option`-shaped fork in every consumer. Which of the two a controller is
//! lives in it as a [`ChromeSurface`], and everything that differs per route
//! reads THAT rather than being told twice: where the bar's pin is remembered
//! (one settings field per surface), and whether the surface has a rail at
//! all. The traffic-light questions are
//! macOS-only at heart (`app_chrome::platform`): frameless Windows/Linux
//! answer constant `false` and the row's leading control starts at the resting
//! padding.
