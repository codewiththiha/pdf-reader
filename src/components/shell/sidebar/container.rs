//! The rail's container: the `<aside>` and its four slots, written once and
//! mounted from one of two places — [`crate::components::shell::sidebar::push`]
//! (docked, a flex sibling of the page) or
//! [`crate::components::shell::sidebar::overlay`] (floating, a fixed
//! wrapper outside the reader's stacking context). The two mount points
//! cannot collapse into one component: an overlay rail that sat inside
//! `.reader-bg` would paint under the title bar's band, so it mounts as the
//! page's sibling instead — see `overlay.rs` for the full stacking story.
//! Each wrapper self-gates on the shell controller's layout, which is what
//! "routes" the rail between the two.
//!
//! The `<aside>` is ALWAYS mounted (in whichever slot is live) and slides
//! its `width` between 18rem and 0 (single-phase, no two-phase unmount).
//! The inner content stays fixed at `w-72` so it never collapses —
//! `overflow-hidden` on the aside clips it while closed. When collapsed
//! the content is made `inert` so the clipped rail can't be
//! tab-focused / activated.
//!
//! THE TOGGLE SLIDES, unless told not to. The aside tweens its width over
//! `SIDEBAR_SLIDE_MS` (the shell controller's machine timing), and
//! `.sidebar-aside { contain: layout style }` keeps the reflow from
//! escaping the aside. The page follows the rail on every frame of that
//! slide — that is `follow_watcher`'s container follow, not a refit, and
//! the burst costs one raster pass because a follow holds its commit until
//! the container goes quiet.
//!
//! Tab switches (Thumbs ↔ Outline) still use `invisible` on the inactive
//! panel so the virtualization window stays engine-bound and a switch back
//! is instant. `hidden` (`display:none`) is still forbidden: its height
//! collapse would re-evict the window and re-render every thumb.
//!
//! Gotcha: each reactive `class=("name", cond)` toggle becomes one
//! `classList.add("name")` call — a space-separated token throws a swallowed
//! SyntaxError and the class is silently never applied. Keep every conditional
//! class to a SINGLE token (hence `w-0` and `border-r-0` as separate toggles).
