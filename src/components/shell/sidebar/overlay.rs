//! The floating rail's mount point: a fixed wrapper that fades in over the
//! page from the window's left edge, plus the edge-hover affordance that
//! opens it. Self-gating — the page mounts it as a sibling of the reader
//! surface and it renders nothing while the shell controller says the
//! layout is docked.
//!
//! WHY A SIBLING, NOT A CHILD. The rail mounts OUTSIDE `.reader-bg`, which
//! is a stacking context (`position: relative` + `z-index: 0`): everything
//! inside it paints below the title bar's band, a SIBLING of `.reader-bg`
//! at `--z-bar`. A floating rail that the bar paints over loses its whole
//! header to the glass — the close, search and More buttons sit in the top
//! 48px, exactly where the band is. Out here the rail's own `--z-popover`
//! outranks the bar, so it covers the bar's left corner (the Library button
//! included) and takes the traffic lights with it, and the bar reads as one
//! full-width surface either way. The settings modal uses the same escape.
//!
//! THE RAIL FADES — it does not slide. The native traffic lights sit pinned
//! over this wrapper's top-left corner and can only appear and disappear,
//! so a transform slide off the edge would travel under buttons that cannot
//! follow it; a fade is the one motion the rail and the lights can make
//! together, and the shell controller's close hold times the fade out so
//! the lights release on the frame the rail finishes disappearing. The
//! class list is the contract the aside keeps too, so the two shapes live
//! here as literals rather than an interpolation — a `format!` per frame
//! invites a token to go missing. `fixed`, not `absolute`: this wrapper
//! sits OUTSIDE `.reader-bg`, so there is no positioned ancestor left to
//! resolve against and the viewport is the honest box.
//!
//! A faded-out rail is still a box on screen, so the wrapper drops to
//! `pointer-events-none` while it is closed — otherwise an invisible strip
//! down the window's left edge would swallow the very hover the edge strip
//! needs to reopen the rail.
//!
//! EDGE HOVER. Brushing the window's left edge (the 1.5px strip, shown only
//! while the rail is fully closed) or the rail itself holds it open; leaving
//! both lets it close after a short grace. The open restores the panel a
//! close last left behind — `ShellController::open_last_panel` — which is
//! the same tracker the close hold's paint hold uses, so there is exactly
//! one notion of "the last panel" in the app.
