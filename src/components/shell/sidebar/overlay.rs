//! The floating rail's mount point: a fixed wrapper that slides over the
//! page from the window's left edge, plus the edge-hover affordance that
//! opens it. Self-gating — the page mounts it as a sibling of the reader
//! surface and it renders nothing while the shell controller says the
//! layout is docked.
//!
//! WHY A SIBLING, NOT A CHILD. The rail mounts OUTSIDE `.reader-bg`, which
//! is a stacking context (`position: relative` + `z-index: 0`): everything
//! inside it paints below the title bar's band, a SIBLING of `.reader-bg`
//! at `--z-bar`. A floating rail that the bar paints over loses its whole
//! header to the glass — the close, search and More buttons sit in the top
//! 48px, exactly where the band is. Out here the rail's own `--z-popover`
//! outranks the bar, so it covers the bar's left corner (the Library button
//! included) and takes the traffic lights with it, and the bar reads as one
//! full-width surface either way. The settings modal uses the same escape.
//!
//! THE SLIDE IS A CSS TRANSFORM, and the class list is the contract the
//! aside keeps too, so the two shapes live here as literals rather than an
//! interpolation — a `format!` per frame invites a token to go missing.
//! `fixed`, not `absolute`: this wrapper sits OUTSIDE `.reader-bg`, so there
//! is no positioned ancestor left to resolve against and the viewport is
//! the honest box.
//!
//! EDGE HOVER. Brushing the window's left edge (the 1.5px strip, shown only
//! while the rail is fully closed) or the rail itself holds it open; leaving
//! both lets it close after a short grace. The open restores the panel a
//! close last left behind — `ShellController::open_last_panel` — which is
//! the same tracker the close slide's paint hold uses, so there is exactly
//! one notion of "the last panel" in the app.
