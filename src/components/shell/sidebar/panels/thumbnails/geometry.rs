//! This stays small and testable on purpose: the panel reads the numbers here,
//! while row windowing and scroll bookkeeping now live in
//! `virtual-list-leptos`.
//!
//! Timings are deliberately NOT here. A number that only one module reads is
//! that module's business — the glide's debounce and grace window live in
//! `auto_center`, the skeleton pulse's stop delay in `thumbnail_cell` — so the
//! constant sits next to the code that explains why it has that value.
