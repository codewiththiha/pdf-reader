//! Auto-center the current page in the thumbnail grid: the glide / grace /
//! debounce machinery, split out of `thumbnails/panel.rs`.
//!
//! Two effects live here:
//!   - the "take me to where I am" listener (`pdfreader:reveal-active`),
//!   - the debounced, grace-aware glide that follows the reader's page.
//!
//! Both read the panel-lifetime handles bundled in [`AutoCenter`]; the panel
//! constructs one and passes it in. Pure move from `panel.rs` — no behavior
