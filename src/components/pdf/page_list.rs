//! Virtualized scroll container for the continuous layout.
//!
//! A scroll container (`#page-list`) holding:
//!  - an in-flow spacer whose height equals the full document height, so the
//!    scrollbar spans the whole column,
//!  - a keyed `<For>` over the mounted page window (what is on screen plus a
//!    `RenderBudget` read-ahead, measured in screenfuls so it means the same
//!    thing at every zoom). Each page is an absolutely-positioned wrapper
//!    centered in the column, containing a shared foundation
//!    `PageCanvas`. Evicted pages are
//!    unmounted by `<For>` (their `on_cleanup` unregisters them with the
//!    engine, which zeros the canvas backing store — WKWebView will not
//!    release it on DOM removal alone); entering pages render via
//!    PageCanvas's own `scale` effect.
