//! The machinery a press gesture is made of, shared by the two gestures that
//! need it: [`long_press`](super::long_press), where a hold IS the gesture, and
//! [`draggable_item`](super::draggable_item), where a hold races a movement and a
//! release for the right to answer the press.
//!
//! Both were carrying their own copy of the same four things — the pending-timer
//! type that parks a wasm shim beside the JS handle that can still call it, the
//! clear that drops both, the squared-distance test that decides whether a pointer
//! has left its origin, and the arm-a-timeout dance. Two copies of a
//! lifetime-sensitive dance is two places to get the `Closure` drop order wrong,
//! and getting it wrong is a timeout that fires into freed memory: not a wrong
//! answer a test would catch, but a crash on a timer.
//!
//! What is NOT here is either gesture's own policy. Which of the three a press
//! turned into, what a completed hold suppresses, and whether a finger may drag
//! at all are the callers' — this module only holds the parts that are the same
//! because the platform is the same.
