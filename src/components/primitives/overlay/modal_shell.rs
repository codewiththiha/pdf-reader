//! The modal sheet's chrome: one backdrop, one panel, one lane registration
//! and one Escape rule, in one place.
//!
//! Every sheet in the app — the folder import, the removal receipt, the
//! name collision's question — used to hand-roll the same four things: the
//! dimmed fixed backdrop that closes on a click, the rounded panel that stops
//! the click from reaching it, the overlay lane's arbitration (one modal at a
//! time, and a menu replaces it rather than stacking under it) and the shared
//! Escape rule that peels one layer at a time. Four copies of one contract is
//! four places a sheet can quietly differ about how it closes — and a sheet
//! that closes differently from its siblings is a sheet the reader has to
//! relearn.
//!
//! What is NOT here is the sheet's own face: its header, body and footer are
//! the children, because those genuinely differ — a receipt's heading carries
//! a cover, an import's is a sentence. The panel is a flex column with a
//! scrollable middle, which is the shape all of them already were.
