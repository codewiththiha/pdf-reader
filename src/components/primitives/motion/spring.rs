//! The spring, as a Leptos effect, generic over any 5-field [`SpringValue`]
//! (the floating box, first and foremost: [`app_chrome::floating::types::FloatBox`]).
//!
//! Springs `value` toward `target`; while `snap` is true (dragging / a forced
//! beat / reduced-motion) it jumps instead of wobbling.
//!
//! The frame machinery is [`FrameLoop`], the primitive the zoom tween rides
//! too: one loop, whose step is REPLACED when `target` changes rather than
//! stacked, so a retarget mid-flight carries the spring's velocity over
//! instead of restarting it. `vel` and `last_ms` live outside the Effect for
//! the same reason — velocity survives a retarget, keeping the morph
//! continuous — unless a caller hard-resets via [`SpringBox::reset_to`] when a
//! *new* anchor opens.
//!
//! This module implements [`SpringValue`] for the floating box and for nothing
//! else. A domain type that wants to ride the spring brings its own adapter —
//! the gloss box's is `crate::components::ai::gloss::spring` — because a
//! primitive that imported a feature crate's type would be breakable by that
//! crate, and would make every other consumer of the primitive depend on the
//! feature too.
