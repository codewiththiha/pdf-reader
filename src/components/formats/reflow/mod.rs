//! The reflowable formats' shared machinery: page host, continuous stream,
//! virtualized strip, and the column that measures the real heights.
//!
//! Four components, and not one of them knows whether the document it is laying
//! out came from `txt-core` or `md-core`. The blocks are the same shape, the
//! geometry is the same A4 sheet, the page cut is the same greedy pack — so the
//! layout code is written once, and the ONE decision a format forces is which
//! view paints a block ([`block_render`], which feeds
//! [`BlockView`](super::block_render::BlockView)). That is the whole extent of
//! format awareness in this module: it selects a renderer, it never selects a
//! pipeline.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT here: the `Format` enum itself, the parsing, the
//! pagination maths (all `reflow-core`, `txt-core`, `md-core`), and the page
//! numbers/zoom/navigation the reflowable formats share with the PDF (the
//! reader's own `viewer` state).
