//! One reflowable page: an A4 host carrying its blocks as real DOM text.
//!
//! Where a PDF page stretches a raster, this page lays its blocks out for real —
//! which is also why its zoom looks different under the hood. The host is sized
//! `A4 × scale` and the type inside scales by the SAME factor (every size the
//! typography owns is a scale-1 CSS variable on `<html>` multiplied by the host's
//! own `--ts`), so the layout is identical at every scale and the crisp text is
//! never a stretched bitmap. During a zoom the host reflows frame by frame at the
//! live display scale — cheap, because only the mounted pages are in the DOM —
//! while the PAGE CUT stays put: it was computed at scale 1, and uniform scaling
//! provably preserves it, so pagination is never recomputed for a zoom.
//!
//! Paper treatment is the one place text is SIMPLER than PDF: the host is a
//! TRANSPARENT frame over `.reader-bg` (which paints `--tx-paper`), and the
//! type is set in `--tx-ink` — the very tokens the appearance pipeline
//! already paints — so base mode and tint land on exactly the right colours
//! without the `--canvas-filter` or blend-mode machinery the always-light
//! PDF rasters need. No card, no texture rectangle: the texture rides the
//! scroller that is the surface (see `viewer::texture_surface`).
//!
//! The props mirror [`PdfPageCanvas`](crate::components::formats::pdf::PdfPageCanvas)
//! where they mean the same thing — page, scale, host id, class — so the page
//! host can mount either without a format-specific prop in sight. The PDF
//! host's texture prop has no counterpart here: a page of type carries no
//! texture of its own. Two of the raster's props have no meaning for a
//! page of type and are simply absent: no canvas id (there is nothing for the
//! engine to paint into) and no geometry callback (the page cut already knows how
//! tall a page is). The `spine` side is this page's own, and not a mirror of
//! anything: gutter padding is a stylesheet concern, while a raster's gutter is
//! the spread's gap.
