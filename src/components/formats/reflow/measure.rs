//! The measure column: the DOM's honest answer to "how tall is each block".
//!
//! The open flow seeds pagination from a pure estimate (character counts),
//! which is good enough to lay the book out the instant it opens but is not
//! the truth — real fonts, real kerning, real Markdown constructs all move
//! the numbers. This column renders every block ONCE, offscreen, at scale 1
//! and exactly the typography the pages use, reads the rendered heights,
//! and republishes the page cut from them. After that first pass the cut is
//! measurement-true, and it only moves again when the typography (or the
//! book-layout toggle that changes the column width) changes.
//!
//! Zoom deliberately never reaches this column: heights are scale-1 truths,
//! and a uniform scale provably preserves the cut (see `components::formats::reflow::page`).
