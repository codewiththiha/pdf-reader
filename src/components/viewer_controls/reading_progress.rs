//! The reading-progress strip: a thin accent bar along the bottom edge that
//! fills toward the end as the reader advances. Shared by every view mode so
//! the setting that turns it on means the same thing everywhere — it is NOT
//! vertical-scroll-only.
//!
//! Position + elevation come from the caller (a `Show` gate); this component
//! only renders the strip and its width. The fraction is caller-supplied
//! because each mode computes it differently: a scroll mode divides the strip
//! offset by the axis-appropriate extent, a paged mode divides the current
//! page by the page count. Both are clamped to [0, 1] here so no caller can
//! paint past the edge or backwards.
