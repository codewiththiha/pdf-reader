//! The shared page host: a `.pdf-page` div containing a `<canvas>` and a
//! `.textLayer` div, driven by the JS engine. Used by BOTH view modes.
//!
//! Contract:
//!  - ids are Rust-chosen unique strings; the engine resolves elements by id.
//!  - renders (page, scale) via engine.renderPage / updatePage; reports the
//!    rendered CSS-px size through `on_geometry`.
//!  - registers on first render, unregisters (cancels) when disposed.
//!
//! TWO EFFECTS, deliberately separated (see `effects::fit`):
//!
//!   * the STRETCH effect follows the `scale` prop — which callers wire to
//!     `viewer.zoom.display`. It only ever resizes the host so the bitmap we
//!     already have CSS-stretches to the new layout size. It runs every frame
//!     of a zoom and never triggers a render.
//!   * the RENDER effect follows `viewer.zoom.render` and is suspended while
//!     `viewer.zoom_animating` is true. It produces the one crisp rasterisation
//!     at the end of a gesture.
//!
//! Keeping these in ONE effect was the ghost/double-image bug: a scale change
//! resized the host and kicked off a render in the same run, so every
//! intermediate frame of a zoom cancelled and restarted a rasterisation, and
//! the half-drawn results were what flashed.
