//! Components whose purpose is displaying PDF documents: the page canvas,
//! the four view layouts, and the shells they share. Pure PDF math stays in
//! `pdf-core`; the pdf.js bridge in `pdf-engine`; generic virtualization math
//! in `virtual-list`. Shared DOM lookups live in
//! [`app_chrome::hooks::dom`].
//!
//! [`Viewer`] is the dispatch point; the layouts under `layouts/` arrange
//! pages, the shells under `shells/` own the shared scroller chrome, and
//! [`PageStrip`] is the axis-generic virtualized strip both scroll modes use.
