//! The toolbar's document-name label: correct name, and truncation only when
//! the name would actually collide with something.
//!
//! ## What was wrong
//!
//! 1. The label rendered `doc.title.or(doc.path)` verbatim, so a PDF whose
//!    `/Title` metadata is a stale producer path ("file:///F|/Mis%20docum")
//!    showed that path instead of the file's name. `core::filename` owns the
//!    rules that pick a trustworthy name; this component just renders it.
//! 2. It carried a hard `max-w-40` (160px), so names were folded with `…` while
//!    the toolbar still had plenty of free space.
//!
//! ## How the truncation works now
//!
//! The label gets a *measured* `max-width` in px equal to the real gap between
//! the buttons on its left and the nearest thing on its right, so `truncate`
//! only ever engages on an actual collision:
//!
//! ```text
//!  ┌ px-3 ┬── #toolbar-left-pre ──┬── this label ──┬ … ┬ #toolbar-center ┬ … ┬ #toolbar-right ─┬ px-3 ┐
//!         │ hamburger + Open      │ max-width  ->  │   │ page nav        │   │ search/zoom/…   │
//! ```
//!
//! * When a document is open the page nav is absolutely centered in the
//!   viewport (Single and Continuous), so the label may only grow until it
//!   reaches the nav's left edge.
//! * With no document open there is no centered nav, so the label may grow
//!   all the way to the right-hand control group.
//! * Either way the right group is a hard stop, and everything is derived from
//!   the live element WIDTHS, so a window resize re-measures automatically.
//!
//! Measuring widths (never positions) is deliberate: the label sits between the
//! measured elements, so if the maths depended on its neighbours' x-positions,
//! a wide label would push them, shrink the computed budget, shrink the label,
//! un-push them... a feedback loop that oscillates. Widths of the left/right
//! groups are independent of the label, so the computation is stable in one
//! pass.
//!
//! Below `MIN_LABEL_W` there is no useful name left to show ("P…"), so the
//! label is hidden entirely rather than rendered as a stub — that is the
//! window-width awareness on very narrow windows.
