//! The reflowable reader's texture surface.
//!
//! There are two texture carriers, one per format family:
//!   * PDF — each page carries its own pattern composited over its raster
//!     (see `formats::pdf::canvas` and the PER-PAGE section of
//!     `styles/textures.css`);
//!   * reflowable (text/Markdown) — a page is a transparent frame, so a
//!     per-page rectangle would stamp a page-shaped seam onto the one-piece
//!     paper. The texture rides the scroller that IS the surface — the
//!     paginated shell, the continuous stream, the reflowable strip — as a
//!     background-image with `background-attachment: local`: one repeating
//!     pattern behind all type, scrolling with it, no blend or z-index
//!     machinery (see the SCROLLER TEXTURE section of `styles/textures.css`).
//!
//! This module is the reflowable half's only Rust: it hands each scroller
//! the `texture-*` class it needs and the `--tx-zoom` the stylesheet scales
//! the pitch with. For a PDF document the class is empty — the PDF scroller
//! paints the chrome surface and must never carry a pattern.
