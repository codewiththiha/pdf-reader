//! Left sidebar with panels (outline / thumbnails). The coordinator owns the
//! open/close state machine and composes the chrome row, the book-identity
//! row, the two stacked panels, and the bottom rail (see the sibling modules).
//!
//! The `<aside>` is ALWAYS mounted and animates its `width` between 18rem and 0
//! (single-phase slide, no two-phase unmount). The inner content stays fixed at
//! `w-72` so it doesn't collapse mid-transition — `overflow-hidden` on the aside
//! clips it while closed. When collapsed the content is made `inert` so the
//! clipped rail can't be tab-focused / activated.
//!
//! CLOSE / OPEN. The rail labels (Thumbs / Outline) outro by
//! being clipped as the aside shrinks — a 300ms ease-in-out the reader
//! already has. The panels used to go `visibility:hidden` on the FIRST frame
//! of that slide, so the thumbnail grid popped off while the labels slid
//! away. Worse, toggling visibility on a stack of `filter` + `mix-blend-mode`
//! canvases makes WKWebView allocate a fresh compositor layer per thumb;
//! close-and-reopen-quickly stacked those layers into a RAM spike.
//!
//! So the last-open panel STAYS PAINTED for the whole slide (it fades with
//! `.sidebar-panel.is-outro` and clips with the aside). Only after the 300ms
//! does the grid unmount, which `cancelThumb`s every live canvas and drops
//! the backing stores. A reopen inside that window never unmounts, never
//! re-renders, never reallocates.
//!
//! OPEN is the expensive direction: the width transition reflows the
//! `flex-1` viewer every frame for 300ms while the thumbnail grid mounts
//! its whole first window (≈20–30 pdf.js rasterisations) and the fit
//! effect rescales every page. `SidebarPaint::opening` marks that first
//! 300ms window so the page can defer the cell mounts until the layout
//! has settled — the skeleton shows for the slide, then the grid mounts.
//! On later opens the engine's thumb cache is warm (`starts_cached`), so
//! the gate costs nothing while still keeping the slide jank-free.
//! A close that beats that opening gate must not arm the close hold: no cells
//! existed to preserve. `cells_mounted` guards that path, so toggle spam never
//! mounts canvases during a close that interrupted the opening delay.
//!
//! Tab switches (Thumbs ↔ Outline) still use `invisible` on the inactive
//! panel so the virtualization window stays engine-bound and a switch back
//! is instant. `hidden` (`display:none`) is still forbidden: its height
//! collapse would re-evict the window and re-render every thumb.
//!
//! Gotcha: each reactive `class=("name", cond)` toggle becomes one
//! `classList.add("name")` call — a space-separated token throws a swallowed
//! SyntaxError and the class is silently never applied. Keep every conditional
//! class to a SINGLE token (hence `w-0` and `border-r-0` as separate toggles).
