//! The reading data a removal kept, waiting for the file it came from.
//!
//! Removing a book takes the app's own copy of its file with it, but the
//! marks a reader wrote, the place they stopped at and any name they gave it
//! are theirs: the removal sheet asks, and an answer of *keep* is written
//! down here.
//!
//! A record cannot be keyed by the row it came from — the row is what went —
//! so it is keyed by the file, the one thing a later import still has in
//! common with it. [`claim`] hands the best record for a file to the import
//! that brings it back.
