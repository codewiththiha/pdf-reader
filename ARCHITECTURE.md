This repo now splits virtual scrolling into three layers.

## 1. `virtual-list`: pure geometry

`crates/virtual-list` owns the reusable math:

- list and grid layout contracts
- mounted-window selection from viewport + budget
- dominant-item selection
- offset and total-size queries
- anchor correction for measurement changes and uniform rescaling

It has no DOM, no framework coupling, and is the long-term public crate surface.

## 2. `virtual-list-leptos`: reactive adapter

`crates/virtual-list-leptos` wraps the geometry kernel in a Leptos-friendly adapter:

- `VirtualizerCore` is still pure and unit-testable
- `use_virtualizer` binds browser scroll containers and resize observers
- the public `Virtualizer` exposes reactive mounted items/rows, total size, dominant item, scroll offset and viewport, per-item offsets and sizes, per-item render state, the scroll-to APIs, and the measurement controls (report, suspend, resume, retention grace)

This layer is responsible for DOM measurement flow, scroll scheduling, and keeping the geometry authoritative.

It also owns the split between the MOUNT window and the RENDER band. The mount
window is what the geometry keeps warm; the render band — a tighter window
around the viewport, `VirtualizerOptions::render_band` — decides which of the
mounted items carry real content (`Active`) and which stand as placeholders at
the layout's own sizes (`Blank`). With no band (`render_screens == 0`) every
mounted item is `Active` — the pages mode, where everything the window mounts
renders fully. The stream pairs a wide budget with a band narrower than it, so
a fling slides cheap placeholders past the reader's eyes; every partly-visible
item is inside the band by construction, so nothing on screen is ever a
placeholder, and the band never changes what mounts or what the extent says.

## 3. Reader app: policy + rendering

The app uses the adapter and keeps only app-specific policy locally:

- view-mode state, plus the format-agnostic view policy (page gap, render
  budget, spread arithmetic) that lives in `crates/reader-core`'s `view` module
- toolbar inset
- page rendering, text/search overlays, and chrome
- measurement storage in `css_heights`

`css_heights` is the shared measurement store. It seeds the virtualizer, receives measured page heights, and is rescaled by the zoom actuator on every frame of a zoom. Geometry queries themselves go through the virtualizer and the layout APIs rather than through a parallel app-local model.

## Reader motion principles

1. Zoom animates the LAYOUT. Every frame of the tween rescales the strips
   through the zoom actuator, so the document genuinely resizes under the
   reader's eyes.
2. The actuator holds the document point under the viewport centre exactly
   where it is while it does so — computed gap-aware, because page heights
   scale and the gap between pages does not. Nothing is captured before a
   zoom and nothing is restored after it.
3. Zoom never scales a frozen surface with a CSS transform. A transform
   scales the page gaps along with the pages, the layout deliberately does
   not, and the whole accumulated difference lands at once when the transform
   is swapped for real geometry — which reads as the document jumping.
4. Page hosts stretch the bitmap they already hold. Nothing re-rasterises
   while the scale is moving; the crisp render is issued once, at the settled
   scale, when the transition commits. A container follow is what makes that
   rule non-trivial: a sidebar slide or a window drag relays the layout out on
   every frame and holds its COMMIT until the size has been quiet, so the burst
   costs one render pass rather than one per frame.
5. The virtualizer's window never drives the page number mid-zoom — and it
   catches the page up when the transaction lands, which is what keeps a long
   held follow from leaving the counter on a page the reader has scrolled past.
6. Recently evicted virtual items become zombies briefly (bounded set,
   grace longer than the tween), bridging the window across a zoom.
7. Zombie items never trigger a new PDF render; they keep their DOM and
   their last bitmap until their grace expires.
8. Page turns and reader surfaces (popovers, search, toasts) do not
   fade, slide or bounce in — document content appears instantly.
9. Layout chrome (the sidebar width, overlays) may use short STRUCTURAL CSS
   transitions; decorative entrance keyframes do not come back. Whether they run
   at all is the reader's call: Settings → Layout holds the master switch, and
   Settings → Animations holds one switch per motion the reader models. Both are
   projected into `state::reader::Motion` by the shell, which is what every gate
   reads — the master is applied once, there, and nothing downstream asks twice.
10. The page host is sized by its inline width/height, which ARE the page
    geometry, so it never lets the flex engine renegotiate them — a shrink
    takes the width while the height stays and the paper visibly squishes.
    There is no reflow exception for a resize, and none is needed: the layout
    follows the container on every frame of a slide or a drag, so the host is
    never left wider than its line for a frame the reader can see. A
    hand-picked zoom that overflows the window keeps overflowing — that is the
    page scrolling rather than squishing, exactly as a fit page in the
    horizontal strip does.
11. PDF renders happen only at transaction boundaries, never per frame.
12. A switched-off animation never skips the CHANGE, only the frames. Each gate
    sits where the interpolation happens, not where the change is decided:
    `animation.rs` declines to tween, `follow_watcher` drops the per-frame posts
    of a *gated* burst (a window drag) and lands the end frame once it is quiet,
    `scroll_mode` resolves to `Instant`, and the rail's class list gains
    `no-slide`. So a frozen reader is not a reader with fewer features — it is
    the same geometry, arriving at once. The one resize that is never gated is
    the follow of the sidebar's own width: there the frames ARE the correctness
    (a page may not be wider than the box the flex engine gave it), and landing
    in the frame the container was measured is what keeps a frozen slide to a
    single step instead of a step followed by a correction.
13. An animation that IS the information is not decoration, so the nets do not
    silence it. The loading mark keeps its loop under `prefers-reduced-motion`
    and under the master switch, as a fade in place: a spinner that stopped
    moving reports a hang, which is a different fact and a wrong one. The same
    rule decides how it moves — `transform` or `opacity`, and nothing else,
    because those are the two properties a compositor animates while the main
    thread is blocked, and the frames this mark must not miss are precisely the
    ones a document open takes. (It used to step three `background-position`
    gradients on one box; that is painted, so it froze during the parse it was
    on screen to cover.) Any animation that has to outlive the work it reports
    on is written the same way.

## Continuous reader flow

1. `ReaderPage` builds one `Virtualizer` for the continuous surface.
2. `ScrollShell` binds the scroll container and hands the mounted window to
   `UniversalStripHost`, which picks the format's strip — `PdfPageStrip` or the
   reflowable one. The strip renders `v.items()`, and the PDF's reports measured
   page heights back into both `css_heights` and the virtualizer; a page of type
   is A4 by definition, so there the cut publishes its sizes instead
   (`effects::reader::reflow_layout`).
3. Navigation sync uses the virtualizer for dominant-page tracking and page-to-scroll jumps.
4. Search reveal uses virtualizer offsets plus virtualizer scroll commands.
5. Zoom runs through one controller: commands resolve to a target, the tween relays the layout out through the actuator frame by frame — `css_heights`, both strips and the page hosts all follow the live display scale — and the render scale catches up once, at the end.

## Thumbnail panel flow

The thumbnail sidebar is a separate grid virtualizer:

- width-aware row windowing lives in `virtual-list`
- DOM/reactive wiring lives in `virtual-list-leptos`
- panel-specific constants stay in `src/components/shell/sidebar/panels/thumbnails`

That keeps list and grid virtualization on the same geometry stack while letting each surface keep its own rendering policy.

## Formats: one host, one pipeline per family

The reader has two axes that must not multiply: how a document is *viewed* (single,
spread, two scroll modes) and what it *is* (PDF, plain text, Markdown). The UI is split
along the first axis and the crates along the second, and exactly one file joins them.

- `src/components/viewer/` is shape: the mode dispatch, the four layouts, the shells that
  hold the scroll container, and the reader's own controls (the bottom bar, the overlay
  scrollbar, the page indicator). A layout may not name a format; adding a view mode touches
  this directory and `reader-core`'s `view` module, and no format crate.
- `src/components/formats/` is substance: `pdf/`, `reflow/`, `txt/`, `md/`. Adding a format
  touches this directory, one parser crate, and one match arm in the open flow.
- `src/components/viewer/page_host.rs` is the seam, and the only file in the viewer layer
  allowed to ask which format is open. `UniversalPageHost` takes a page plus a `PageSlot`
  (single, spread left, spread right) and mounts either `PdfPageCanvas` or `ReflowPage`;
  `UniversalStripHost` does the same for the virtualized strip; `UniversalStreamHost`
  answers for continuous reading, the one case where the two pipelines disagree about the
  *surface* rather than the *content*. Both page components take the same props — page,
  scale, host id, `class` — read the page texture from context, and answer for exactly one
  page number; the PDF's extras (canvas id, gloss overlay, geometry callback) are built from
  the slot inside the host, so no layout ever passes a format-specific prop. The host also
  owns the DOM identity of a page (the `sp-`/`dp-`/`hp-`/`cont-` ids), which is why the
  floating chapter label and a selection anchor address a page of Markdown exactly as they
  address a page of pixels.

The state mirrors it: `state::reader::document` holds the document's identity (path, title,
format, page count, outline) and, beside it, a `DocumentContent` with two halves: `metrics`,
the page-size store both families write (`page1_size`, `intrinsic`, `css_heights`), and
`reflow`, the reflowable pipeline's own blocks, heights and current cut. A PDF fills the
metrics from the file and a reflowable document from its page cut, so the virtualizers, the
zoom coordinator and the progress chrome never ask who measured what.

## Text and Markdown pipeline

Plain text and Markdown share a pipeline that reuses the page machinery above the leaf
renderer. The split is deliberate: PDF pages are rasters the engine paints, text pages
are A4 hosts the reader lays out with real type — but both report the same per-page sizes into
the same virtualized strips, so view modes, zoom, navigation and search reveal stay
format-agnostic.

- `crates/reflow-core` is the shared half of that, pure (no DOM, no Leptos): the block shape
  and its splitting rules, the A4 page geometry and its spine sides, the block-granular page
  cutter, the height estimate, the typography resolution (schema lives in `reader-core`'s
  `settings::typography`) and the search over the blocks — which is a call into the scan
  `reader-core` lends the PDF's page-text index too, so an occurrence ordinal means the same
  thing in both families. `crates/txt-core` and
  `crates/md-core` sit on top of it with one parser each — normalising and paragraph-cutting
  for text, construct classification, prose subdivision, front-matter metadata and heading
  extraction for Markdown — so a format owns its syntax and nothing else. Everything is
  unit-testable on the host.
- On open, the file is parsed into blocks, oversized prose paragraphs are subdivided on line
  boundaries into continuation-flagged chunks (`subdivide`, five lines each), and an estimate cut
  is published immediately, so the reader is up the instant the bytes land. The subdivision is
  what lets the paginator pack pages tightly: no single block is taller than a few lines of type,
  so a page bottom never carries a blank band a pushed-over paragraph used to leave. The heights
  are then refined block by block as the reader's own rows render: each mounted row reports its
  measured scale-1 height into the shared store (`effects::reader::reflow_measure`), debounced so
  a fling costs one re-cut, not one per frame, and a typography or width-dial change re-runs the
  pure estimate instead of any DOM. Pagination is therefore measurement-true, and re-cuts whenever
  a typography knob moves — holding the reader on the block they were reading.
- `set_initial_heights` and `recut` are the two doors into the cut, its inverse block→page map
  and the per-page size bookkeeping, and both write the split and its map together, so a split can
  never disagree with its map.
- Zoom never re-paginates. The cut is computed at scale 1; a page host is sized `A4 × scale` and
  its type resolves through a scale-1 CSS variable times the host's own `--ts`, so the layout is
  identical at every scale and uniform scaling provably preserves the cut. During the tween the
  mounted pages reflow frame by frame at the live display scale — cheap, because the window is
  bounded — while the cut itself stays put.
- Vertical reading is the one deliberate deviation from "pages everywhere": a reflowable document
  in the vertical mode renders as the CONTINUOUS STREAM (`components::formats::reflow::stream`), which
  virtualizes the blocks themselves — not page-cut units — on the shared scroller id, with the
  window itself painted as the paper and the blocks flowing in a reading column narrowed by the
  page margin and positioned by the column-alignment setting. The page cut still backs the paged
  modes, the page bookkeeping and the resume flow; it simply is not what scrolls. The stream owns
  its zoom relayout (the page virtualizer is unbound there, and `navigation_sync`'s two page arms
  stand down), maps its dominant block back onto `viewer.page` for progress persistence, reveals
  search hits through its own virtualizer, and runs a render band wider than its visible window:
  rows inside the band carry type, rows the band has not reached are empty boxes at the
  virtualizer's own heights. What it renders is also what it measures: the mounted rows report
  their scale-1 heights into the shared store (`effects::reader::reflow_measure`), which debounces
  them into the page cut, so a column narrower than the page model still lays out truthfully.
  Single, spread and horizontal keep real A4 sheets.
- A Markdown document gets the sidebar's outline panel for real: `md_core::headings_of_blocks`
  finds the headings among the final blocks and `effects::reader::reflow_outline` projects them
  onto the live block→page table, so the chapter tree follows every re-cut instead of going
  stale. The tree lands in the same `document.outline` signal a PDF's `/Outlines` dictionary
  fills, in the same `reader_core::outline::OutlineNode` shape — the panel cannot tell the two
  apart, which is the point.
- Search hits are painted by the row that renders the block
  (`components::formats::reflow::highlight`), one layer per row, because in the continuous stream
  the row is the unit that mounts and unmounts — a page-level layer would have nothing to attach
  to, the same problem the stream's gloss layer solves by covering the whole column. The painter
  re-finds the query in the row's rendered text and covers each occurrence, so the boxes a text
  document shows are the boxes a PDF shows: one rule set styles both subtrees
  (`styles/components/search.css`), both cap what they paint at the same number, and both name the
  match the reader is on the same way — the engine pairs a page with a per-page ordinal, a
  reflowable match pairs a block with an occurrence (`reader_core::search::BlockHit`). The walk it
  measures with is the gloss projection's (`formats::reflow::spot`), so a hit and a stroke cannot
  disagree about where a character is, and the scan that finds the occurrences is
  `reader_core::search::occurrence_spans` — the one both search pipelines run — so the ordinal a
  match carries and the ordinal a box counts cannot disagree either.
- Format questions are asked once: `Format::is_reflowable` in `reader-core` is the predicate,
  `ReaderState::reflowable()` is the tracked read of it, and the UI never tests an extension
  or a document variant inline. The leaf renderer is the same deal one level down:
  `components::formats::block_render::BlockView` dispatches a block to the text or Markdown view
  from the document's format, so the page and the stream share one
  answer and none of them knows what Markdown is.
- Text never enters blend mode and never touches the paper session: a text page is recoloured by
  its own tokens, so the backdrop's colour machine is gated off for the format (the Theme tab
  hides the Paper section accordingly). Body ink has its own comfort dial —
  `ink_contrast`, a `color-mix` of the theme's ink toward its paper, exposed as the "Text ink
  intensity" slider while a text document is open. Search scans the blocks in-process (the
  document is its own index), mapping hits through the current page cut, and a reveal scrolls to
  the block the match names. The scan and the snippet window are `reader_core::search`'s, shared
  with the PDF index: one case-folding rule, one non-overlapping rule, one context window, and
  therefore one meaning for "the nth occurrence".
 Progress persistence
  saves the fractional stream position alongside the page, so a continuous read resumes where it
  stopped, not at a page top.

## How the AI layer finds a word: the host protocol and the spot

Selection, the Explain pill, the gloss card and the persisted highlights all have to
answer one question — *where in the document are these words?* — and the answer
used to be a PDF's: a page number and a rect in page space, measured against a
`.pdf-page`. Nothing else about the feature is PDF-specific, so the question was
generalised instead of the feature being forked per format.

- **The hosts declare themselves.** Every page host carries `data-reader-host`
  (the format family that painted it: `pdf` or `reflow`) and `data-host-page`
  (the 1-based page it shows), and every rendered block carries
  `data-block-index` plus the matching element id (`tx-block-<index>`, from
  `viewer::page_host::block_row_id`). The selection tracker (which lives in the
  reader bundle, not the engine's) and the app's capture find their host by
  asking for those attributes rather than for a class, so a format joins the AI
  feature by publishing two attributes and no selector anywhere grows a second
  name; the id is the lookup half of the same deal, because the gloss projection
  resolves a mark's block once per mark per scroll frame and an id read is the
  cheapest question the DOM answers. The surrounding sentence a selection
  reports is cut out of the same protocol — a PDF's text layer, or a reflowable
  document's block row, whichever the selection is inside — and a row is the
  better sentence anyway: a page of type is thousands of characters, and a word
  is disambiguated by its clause.
- **The event grew two optional fields.** `pdfreader:selection-detail` now
  carries `{ text, context, rect, host, spot }`. `host` says which family painted
  the selection, so the app decides the pipeline from the event rather than from
  the open document and a selection that outlives a document switch cannot be
  projected through the wrong format's maths; `spot` is a reflowable selection's
  durable identity. Both are `#[serde(default)]`, so a PDF's event — which
  carries neither — deserializes unchanged.
- **A reflowable mark remembers characters, not pixels.** Plain text and Markdown
  have no fixed page grid: the measure pass, a font-size change, a window resize
  and a column-alignment flip all re-cut the pages, and a page-space rect then
  points at whatever text moved under it. The identity that survives all of it is
  the block and the character range inside its rendered text
  (`ai_core::gloss::ReflowSpot`), persisted as a versioned envelope in
  `GlossMark.context` — `rf1:{"spot":{block,start,end},"text":"…"}`. The envelope
  keeps the stored schema the one `PageAnchor` shape, and it carries the sentence
  beside the spot because `context` is also what the model is handed when a mark
  is re-explained from storage, long after its selection is gone
  (`reflow_anchor::explain_context` reads the prose back out; a PDF's bare
  sentence passes through untouched).
- **Offsets are Unicode code points**, counted over the block's text nodes in
  document order with the stroke layer skipped (a mark's
  button carries the glossed word as its accessible name, and counting that would
  shift every offset after it). The conversion to the UTF-16 units a DOM `Range`
  speaks happens once, at `set_start`/`set_end`, so an emoji or a mathematical
  alphanumeric is one character on both sides of the wire — in the engine's
  TypeScript (`[…str].length`, `Range.toString`) and in the app's Rust
  (`.chars().count()`). For Markdown the offsets count the RENDERED text, which is
  why a heading's stroke survives its `#`s not being on screen — and why a search hit found in
  syntax the renderer drops has nothing to cover: the results list still counts it, and no box is
  painted for it.
- **The walk is shared.** `formats::reflow::spot` is the one module that answers "where is this
  character, in pixels": the text-node walk, the character→code-unit conversion, the `Range` over
  a span and that range's client rects. The gloss projection and the search-hit layer both call it,
  and the layers a walk must skip — a stroke's button, a hit's box — are one list in it rather
  than one per caller.
- **Two resolvers, one dispatch.** `anchor::anchor_resolver` answers in viewport
  space for the Explain pill and the gloss card; `anchor::stroke_resolver` answers in
  a stroke layer's own coordinates, relative to the element it measured. Neither
  knows a format: both build a `FormatAnchorBridge` per call, decided from the
  document that is open, and read the spot from the mark or the selection itself.
  A page number on a reflowable mark is a filter hint for its stroke layer, never
  an identity — `block_page` is what says where the words are now, and a re-cut
  moves a mark onto another page without touching the mark.
- **Unresolvable means hidden.** A spot whose block is virtualized away, orphaned
  by a re-parse, or written by an envelope version this build cannot read resolves
  to `None`, which the watchers already treat as "the origin left the viewport"
  and the stroke layer paints as nothing. Painting a stale capture-time box
  instead would highlight whatever words happen to be there now.
- **What makes a stroke look again.** Scale, for a PDF. For type: scale, scroll,
  container size, and `viewer::refresh::reflow_invalidation` — a fingerprint of the cut's
  block starts, the geometry it was cut with, the stream's extent and the view
  mode. It is a `u64` rather than the vectors so a re-measure that re-cut nothing
  costs one hash and wakes nobody, and the typography is deliberately not read:
  every knob that moves type moves the cut, and one that does not (the ink dial,
  the column's alignment) cannot move a mark. The search-hit layer reads the same
  fingerprint and the committed scale, but not scroll: its boxes live inside the row they cover,
  so a scroll carries them along rather than leaving them behind.
- **Three mounts.** A stroke layer is mounted by a PDF page, by a text page
  (`.tx-page`), and once for the whole reading column by the continuous stream —
  whose blocks are virtualized individually rather than paginated, so a per-page
  layer would have nothing to attach to and a per-block layer would drop every
  mark whose block scrolled out of the window. All three are the same
  `position:absolute; inset:0` box inside the element their resolver measured,
  which is why `styles/components/gloss.css` defines `.gloss-layer` once rather
  than under `.pdf-page`: nothing in it is about a raster. `mix-blend-mode:
  multiply` reads the same over ink on paper as over ink on a canvas, and the
  dark-theme `screen` swap is about the backdrop being dark, not about it being a
  bitmap.
- **Order on open.** A reflowable document's marks are loaded from storage before
  `apply_heights` publishes the block→page map, so the first page — or the first
  stream window — already paints them instead of gaining them a frame later. Dedup
  compares spots rather than pixels (`same_glossed_spot`), which is what stops a
  re-gloss after a scroll from stacking a second stroke on the same word.

## The library: addresses, shelves and the rescan ledger

The library's invariants are subtler than the reader's, because the thing it describes is a
filesystem the app does not own. Everything that decides anything is in `crates/library-core`,
which is pure — no filesystem, no wasm, no DOM — so the rules below are host tests rather than
behaviour you discover by pointing the app at a real folder.

### A book is an address

`library_core::book::Origin` has two variants and the first one is the app's whole history:

- `Origin::Linked { src }` — read in place. The book *is* that path. Nothing in the workspace
  moves, renames, copies or deletes it, and a path that stops resolving makes the book `missing`
  rather than gone: the row keeps its resume point and every shelf it is on, because a reader who
  moved a folder wants the page they were on back, not an empty shelf.
- `Origin::Stored { src, store }` — the app copied the bytes into its own data directory. `src`
  survives as provenance, which is what a relink offers to copy from again. `Origin::path` answers
  `store`, never `src`: repointing a stored book at its source would quietly turn "the app keeps
  its own copy" back into "the app reads your folder again".

The corollary runs through every layer. A shelf holds book *ids* and nothing else, so a drag
between shelves edits an ordered list of ids and cannot touch a file — which is what makes filing a
read-in-place book safe by construction rather than by care. `services::library::arrange` is the
only module that deletes a byte, and only one the app wrote.

### Identity is a fingerprint, not a path

`library_core::book::Fingerprint` is `{size, mtime_ms, head_hash}`: FNV-1a over the first 8 KiB
(`library_core::hash`), not over the file. Size and stamp are what a *move* preserves, so a file
dragged to another folder inside a watched tree still resolves to the book it already is; the head
hash separates the collision that matters, which is two different books of the same length touched
in the same millisecond. Reading 8 KiB rather than 2 GB is what makes a rescan on every window
focus affordable.

A row migrated from the previous schema carries no measurement, so it carries
`Fingerprint::placeholder` — derived from the address, so two migrated books can never share one —
and the `fp_pending` mark. `library_core::blob::LibraryBlob::awaiting_check` is the gate: a rescan
that diffed real fingerprints against placeholders would match nothing and add a second copy of
every book the folder already held.

The fingerprint is the identity, and one identity is normally one row — but not by force. Two rows
of one file are allowed, so the sanitizer dedupes by *id* rather than by fingerprint, and every
path-keyed writer treats the twins as the twins they are: a read and a path check update *all* the
rows at an address (the reading position is a fact about the file, not about the row), and a
removal sweeps the address's gloss, cover and store copy only when no remaining row reads from it
(`services::library::arrange`'s `sweep_path`). The ledger's registry is first-wins per fingerprint,
which is a safe answer while every row of one fingerprint reads one address — and the reason a
relink is dropped when the address it would write is one another row already reads, which is what
keeps it safe now that two folders can each hold a copy.

The list those rules run over is a list of ROWS, not of books. `book::Row` is either a `Book` or a
`Row::Link` — a name, a target and a stamp, and nothing else — and the split is what every rule in
this crate reads first. A content rule walks the book rows and steps over the links
(`book::book_rows`), because a pointer has no fingerprint to compare, no address to check and no
resume point to write; a place rule — a membership, a drag, a removal, the order a level renders
in — walks the rows, because a link is on a shelf exactly as a book is. A link is dropped by the
sanitizer when the book it points at is gone, and by a removal that takes that book, because the
one failure mode a pointer has is pointing at nothing.

Two rows can also stop being twins, and that is a mark on the row rather than a second kind of row.
`Book::independent` is what the conflict sheet's *as new* answer writes, and it opts the row out of
exactly half of the sharing above: its resume point becomes its own, and its highlights move to a
key carrying its id (`Book::gloss_key`), so no other row can name them and a removal of either row
takes nothing from the other. It does not opt out of the address's fate — whether the file resolves
is a fact about the file, so `book::apply_check` still writes every row at it, and the cover stays
the file's art. Which rows a read belongs to is one function (`book::rows_for_read`, indices so a
caller can hold the answer across the write it is about to make), and the three writers of a resume
point all read it: the open's record, the progress debounce and the close's flush. That is also why
an open carries the row it came from — `document::open_row` for a card, a list row or the menu's
Open, which opens a book and reveals the target of a link, and `document::open_path` for a drop, an
*open with* and a dialog — because an address cannot say which of two rows the reader clicked, and a
reader who asked for a book of its own is a reader who means that book. The rest of the library prefers a shared row wherever it resolves a content: the
ledger's registry indexes shared rows first and a private one only for a content nothing else
holds, and `book::add_book` resolves an import to a shared row and never to a private one.

### The ledger

`library_core::ledger::diff_folder` is the module the edge cases live in. It takes a folder's
ledger, the global fingerprint registry and the files a walk found, and answers one `ScanAction`
per file. The decision table is the test suite:

| Scan finds a fingerprint… | Book exists? | This folder placed it? | Removed from it? | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| not seen before | – | – | – | `ScanAction::Add` |
| known, at the address already stored | yes | yes | – | `ScanAction::Skip` |
| known, at a different address | yes | yes | – | `ScanAction::Relink` |
| known, but the book is missing | yes | no | – | `ScanAction::Relink` |
| known, placed by another folder | yes | no | – | `ScanAction::Skip` — an explicit import's `Add` |
| seen here, but the row is gone | no | yes | – | `ScanAction::Skip` |
| anything | – | – | yes | `ScanAction::Skip` |

That last cell is the one row the two tables answer differently, and it is the row a reader meets
when they import a second folder holding a byte-identical copy of a book the first one placed. A
rescan stays quiet, because staying quiet is a rescan's whole job and the alternative is a book
reappearing on every window focus. An explicit import is a reader asking for *this* folder, and the
file in it is a file this folder has, so it is a book on this folder's shelf: handing back an empty
shelf for a folder the reader can see files in is the answer that reads as a broken import. The
address the library already holds is not a second book either way — that is the same file, and the
heal in `import::run_folder` measures the row rather than adding one beside it.

Two rows of one fingerprint at two addresses are what that makes possible, and one guard keeps them
honest: the registry is first-wins per fingerprint, so it names one of the two, and a relink that
would point a book at an address another row already reads is a relink of the wrong row. The walk
drops it, and both folders' rescans stay quiet.

Row six is the rule the whole design exists for: a book the reader dragged off a folder's shelf is
still in the library, its fingerprint is still in `WatchedFolder::placed`, and the next rescan
leaves it where the reader put it. Row seven is the tombstone in `WatchedFolder::ignored`, checked
before every other row, because a file the reader deleted from the library is still on disk and
still admitted by the folder's options. `library_core::ledger::tombstone` writes it only into the
folders that *placed* the book, so removing a hand-added book poisons no watched folder.

A relink rewrites the address and clears `missing`; it does not touch the id, the resume point or a
single shelf membership. That is what makes "the file moved" and "the book was re-filed" orthogonal.

A tombstone is a record and not a fingerprint, because it has a second job. Keeping a file out of every
later rescan needs one hash; offering the book back needs the name the shelf showed, the address it
lived at, the shelf it was filed on and when it went. Beside the tombstones each folder keeps what its
last scan saw, restricted to the fingerprints it placed — and `recoverables` answers both halves of
"what could this folder give back?" from those two lists plus the library's memberships, with no
filesystem involved. That is what lets the menu open on a click: a restore re-measures the single file
it is about to import, which is the only place freshness actually matters.

Two rules keep a restore from lying. It measures before it promises, and a measurement that comes back
empty leaves the tombstone exactly where it was — losing it would lose the only record the book was ever
there. And it takes the tombstone out without touching `placed`, which the import that follows writes
when the book actually lands: a fingerprint the ledger skips with no book behind it is the one state a
folder cannot recover from on its own.

### When the level already holds the name

A placement — a drag, a lift out to the root, a bulk filing, a loose-file import — whose NAME the
level it is going to already holds is a question, not a skip. It used to be a skip, and the skip
was the bug the sheet exists for: the placement resolved the arrival to the row the library already
had, the level found that row already a member of itself, and nothing at all happened — which to
the reader was a book disappearing into the shelf it was dropped on.

The question is about a name on a level, and nothing else. `library_core::conflict` is the whole
rule and it is pure: `collide` compares the arrival's name against the BOOK rows of the target
level, case-insensitively, and answers with the row that holds it. A shelf's level is its own
member list; the root is a level too and its list is the unfiled rows the "All" view renders, so a
drop on Home beside an unfiled row of one name asks exactly as a drop on a shelf does. Four things
never ask, and each is a rule rather than a patch:

- a **link** row, on either side — it is not a book, so it never collides and never blocks, which
  is what lets a reader put a pointer on a shelf beside the book it points at;
- the row **being moved** itself, so a reorder and a duplicate filed on three shelves both stay
  quiet;
- a level that holds **no book of that name**, which includes an empty folder;
- a **counter** name, so `1_1` arriving beside `1` is the second book it already is and not a
  reason to ask again.

Names and not fingerprints, and the reason is what a shelf is. Two rows of one file were two books
the reader could not tell apart: same name, same cover, same resume point, same highlights, and a
removal of one that took the other's marks with it. A collision asked of a fingerprint could only
answer with row operations — keep both, replace, fold — and "keep both" meant two rows of one
address sharing everything an address holds. A collision asked of a name answers with a name: the
arrival becomes `1_1`, and the two rows are two books a reader can see are two books. Fingerprints
are not gone from the library, they are gone from *this* question — a watched folder's rescan
(`library_core::ledger`) and a path check (`book::apply_check`) still need one, because "is this
the file I already placed" is a question about bytes and only bytes can answer it.

The sheet (`features::library::conflict_modal`) offers three answers, and WHICH three is a fact
about the arrival rather than a setting on the sheet: a file arriving has no row of its own, and a
row being moved has two books in the question. `Arrival::is_import` is the whole of the branch, and
the two answer sets are two types (`conflict::Answer`, `conflict::MoveAnswer`), so a sheet cannot
offer a file's answer to a move or a move's to a file.

An **import** asks what to put on this level, and nothing it offers is destructive:

- **Already imported** places nothing and reveals the row that is already there
  (`services::library::reveal` — its shelf, then its card, lit). It is the answer that means *I did
  not intend to add anything*, and it is what the old silence should have been.
- **Add as new** places the arrival under the next free name (`conflict::next_name`, counted
  against that level's own names and promised on the row before the click), as a second book of the
  address marked `Book::independent`, so its highlights and its resume point are its own rather
  than the first copy's.
- **Make link** places a `Row::Link` instead of a copy: a row on this level with the book's name,
  no fingerprint, no page, no cover and no storage, which opens by revealing the book wherever it
  is filed. It is the answer for "I want it reachable from here" that used to be a second copy of a
  two-gigabyte file, or nothing.

A **move** asks which of two books this level keeps, and its survivor is always the row already
here — its id is what every shelf membership and every key in storage names, so a fold that moved
it would orphan both:

- **Merge** folds the moved row into it by `book::fold_books`: the further place in it wins (and on
  a page tie the deeper stream fraction, because a merge never sends a reader backwards), the page
  count is the best either row knew, names and authors fill gaps and never overwrite, the stamps
  keep the first join and the last read, a measurement beats a placeholder, and an address is dead
  only when both rows say so. The moved row's shelves become the survivor's and then it goes —
  through `arrange::drop_row`, which is a removal without a tombstone, because the content stays in
  the library through the survivor and a tombstone for a fingerprint the library still holds is
  noise in a folder's restore menu. Its highlights travel first, while both keys can still be read
  (`union_marks`, by `GlossMark::same_spot`, keeping their ids so the AI answers ride along): the
  sweep a removal rides takes the dissolving row's list with it, so a fold that ran afterwards
  would be a merge that deleted them.
- **Replace** sends the row that was here out of the library and seats the arrival in its SLOT —
  an overwrite stays where the thing it replaced was — and on every other shelf the displaced row
  was filed on, because a replace that quietly took a book off shelves the question never mentioned
  is a removal nobody asked for. This is the one destructive answer on either sheet, and it is the
  reason a row says what it takes before the click rather than the sheet asking twice afterwards:
  the name of the row going, and how many highlights leave with it.
- **As new** is the import's naming on a row that already exists: the moved row takes the next free
  name and lands beside the one it collided with.

One question at a time, and a batch — a drag of four, an import of ten — lands its clean half at
once and queues the rest on `state::library::LibraryState::conflict_waiting`: answering pops the
next onto the screen, and Cancel drops them, which is what Cancel has always meant. There is no
"apply to all" and no queue bookkeeping beyond the list — with one exception, below, where the
questions are forty files of one folder rather than forty gestures.

A FOLDER has its own spelling of the question, asked before the walk rather than after it: an
import whose name the root level already holds (`library_core::conflict::collide_shelf`, which
counts the level's SHELF names and nothing else) raises the folder sheet, because two doors of one
name on one level are two doors a reader cannot tell apart — which is what two books of one name
are. Its answers are about the whole run rather than one placement: *Add as new* mints the folder's
root under the next free counter (`next_shelf_name`) and imports into its own tree; *Make link*
imports nothing and leaves a pointer row instead — a `Row::Link` whose target is a SHELF id, which
the ids' first letters keep disjoint from a book's, and whose tap reveals the shelf it names
(`services::library::reveal_shelf`: its level, then its card, lit); *Merge into it* maps the
folder's root rung onto the shelf that is here — the folder's `shelf_map` carries the promise, so
every later rescan keeps it — and every root-level file whose NAME that shelf already holds goes
to the compact per-file sheet: Merge (the row stays and takes the file's measurement), Replace, or
As new, one at a time or, behind the sheet's apply-to-all switch, one answer for the whole queue.
A file nothing collides with simply goes in: new books in a merged folder are the default, not a
case — and "a file nothing collides with" is answered over EVERY file the walk found, not only the
ones the ledger marked new: a planned tree (a merge's, or an *as new* one) owes a membership of the
row the library holds for each file it already knows, because one content is one identity and one
identity is one row, and a second shelf of one folder is a second arrangement rather than a second
copy. A folder colliding with its OWN previous shelf asks too — a reader who picked a folder and
clicked Import asked for an answer, and a run that ends on "Imported 0 books" with no sheet in
between is the silent nothing the book collision used to be — and it gets the same three answers,
worded as the continuation it is. Its merge is the reconcile a re-import asks for: every root-level
file whose name the shelf holds goes to the compact per-file sheet — a file's OWN row included,
which is what makes re-importing one folder a question per book rather than a shrug — and *Merge*
there is the one-book answer that keeps everything as it is. A nesting still asks nothing at all,
because a nesting writes a parent and not a membership.

Nesting asks nothing at all, and that is the rule rather than an oversight: filing a folder inside
another writes no membership, so nothing arrives on the parent's level for a name to collide with.
A watched folder's own rescan never asks either — staying quiet is the ledger's job — and a folder
walk keeps the fingerprint dedupe it always had, because four hundred files are not four hundred
questions.

### Where the work happens

The split is IO on one side and decisions on the other, and the wire between them is declared once:

- `src-tauri/src/commands/library.rs` walks, measures, copies and deletes. It filters during the
  walk with `library_core::folder::FolderOpts::admits_file` so a folder of forty thousand
  screenshots never crosses the wire, refuses symlinks and hidden directories, caps the depth and
  the result count, and gates every path through the crate's existing document gate. Its delete
  command only removes a path that canonicalises inside the app's own store directory.
- `library_core::wire` holds the four types that cross (`ImportProgress`, `PathCheck`,
  `StoreRequest`, `StoreResult`). Both sides depend on `library-core`, so there is one declaration
  and no contract test needed to prove the halves agree — which is an improvement on the AI chunk
  envelope, written twice and held together by a test.
- `services::library::import` runs the ledger and writes the answer. Nothing is committed until the
  whole answer is known: the scan, the diff and the copies all run against local copies of the
  three lists, and the state is set once. A shelf that filled in file by file would repaint per
  file, and a failure half way through would leave the library holding books whose bytes never
  arrived. A copy failure is per-file, so one locked file costs the reader that file and not the
  batch.
- `effects::app::library` installs the three app-lifetime pieces: the sink that folds progress beats
  into `state::library`'s task list (a run outlives the page that started it, so a listener mounted
  on the page would stop counting at the route flip), the startup measurement pass, and the rescan
  on `tauri://focus` behind a cooldown.

### Order, in one place

`features::library::content` derives the visible list once — shelf narrows, sort orders, query
filters last — and provides it as `ShelfOrder`. A card cannot work out its own index from the DOM
without counting siblings, which would be a second definition of the order; a drop that lands
"before this card" therefore asks the same function the grid rendered from, and the two layouts
cannot disagree about where "here" is because neither of them owns the answer.

A drop is only given a position while the order is the manual one
(`library_core::view::LibraryView::drag_reorders`), because a shelf sorted by title re-sorts on the
next render and would undo the drop before the reader saw it land. A sorted shelf still accepts the
drop; it appends rather than promising a slot it cannot keep.

### One search, one rule

The bar's filter and the panel under it are one rule in `library_core::query`, spelled once: every
whitespace-separated term has to match one of a book's three fields — title, author, address —
either as a substring, the way search always worked, or as an in-order subsequence that scores
well enough, the fuzzy half. The score rewards the shapes readers type (consecutive runs, starts
of words, the start of a field) and charges the gaps between hits; a subsequence that scores under
two points a term character is too scattered to be a match, so fuzzy forgives a dropped vowel
without forgiving everything. The shelf filters on the rule, the suggestion panel ranks with the
same rule — title outweighing author outweighing address — and the matched character spans travel
with the score, which `features::library::search_suggest` lights so the fuzzy half shows its work.

There is no index, and the panel is no standing derivation. A few thousand one-pass string
comparisons are well inside a frame, and an index would be a second thing to keep in step with the
list it describes; the suggestions are computed at the keystroke, untracked, and stored, so
nothing re-ranks while the reader is not typing and a closed panel costs nothing at all.

### A shelf is a level, not a row

`Shelf::parent` makes the shelves a forest: the root level is the shelves with no parent, and a level
inside one is `library_core::shelf::children_of` on its id. `features::library::content` derives both
halves of the page once — `ShelfOrder` for the books and `FolderOrder` for the shelves at this level —
and provides them to both layouts, so the grid, the list, the selection bar's "All" and the drop that
lands among them are all counting the same level.

The grid renders a folder as a cell of the same grid the books are cells of, which is the whole of
what makes nesting drawable: the shelf tile this replaced spanned the grid to read as a row *of*
books, and a row cannot be inside a row. The dense list draws the same level as a tree: a shelf is a
row that unfolds in place — the shelves filed in it and its own books indenting under it, as deep as
the forest goes — while an Open on the row drills the breadcrumb route, because unfolding is a way
of looking and must not move the reader. The tree is `ShelfTree`, a plain prop bag over the same
rows, which is the component the reader sidebar's shelf tab will mount at its own density.

One relationship in this model can be wrong in a way no single row shows — a shelf filed inside
itself, or inside one of its own children, is a folder that renders on no level and can never be
opened again. So the graph is guarded twice, and the two guards are not redundant:
`library_core::shelf::can_nest` refuses the drop before it is written, and
`library_core::shelf::sanitize` cuts any cycle a restored or hand-edited blob carries, because a rule
enforced only on the way in is a rule one backup can break. Sanitising the shelves LAST in
`library_core::blob::sanitize` is what makes the second guard enough: a folder shelf whose watched
folder is gone is dropped there, and a shelf nested inside it would otherwise be left pointing at a
parent that no longer exists.

Removing a shelf lifts the shelves inside it to the level it was on (`shelf::lift_children`), for the
same reason its books stay in the library: a reader who took one folder apart did not ask to lose the
folders filed in it.

That is the default and not the only answer, because "take this shelf apart" and "get rid of this
shelf and everything in it" are both things a reader means, and only the first of them was reachable.
`features::library::remove_modal` carries the second as a switch on the same receipt — the cascade
belongs in the sheet rather than in a second sheet, because it is a question about the SAME removal,
and what a shelf holds is part of what removing it costs.

Everything on that sheet is measured over the set the removal will actually take, not over what was
clicked: with the cascade on, the books row, the highlight and cover counts, the store copies and the
button's own wording all describe the asked books plus everything inside the asked shelves. A receipt
that itemised the selection and then removed the selection plus a folder's contents would be a receipt
for a different removal than the one it confirmed. The switch is offered only when there is something
inside to decide about — an empty leaf shelf gets no switch — and the store-copy switch only when the
effective set contains a copy the app made, because a control that appears with nothing for it to
decide is a control the reader has to read and then ignore. Two things follow from the cascade being a
change of SET rather than of wording: the shelf rows switch from saying what survives to saying what
goes, since the same words would mean the opposite, and the deletes run deepest-first so
`lift_children` never moves a shelf to the level it was on moments before deleting it. The tree
arithmetic that decides which shelves those are (`subtree`, `deepest_first`) is pure over the shelf
list and host-tested, including the cycle a blob caught between two writes can still carry.

Nesting is not `ShelfKind::Folder`'s `rel`. `rel` is a subfolder's address inside a watched
directory's tree — a rescan key, written by the filesystem's shape. For a FOLDER shelf, `parent`
starts as its projection: the tree on disk is the tree on the shelf, and every scan re-hangs the
folder's shelves on the rung their `rel` names — until the reader moves one by hand. A hand beats
the disk: `library_core::shelf::reparent` accepts the move and marks the row
`Shelf::manual_parent`, and the re-hang passes a marked shelf by, so the move is a promise the next
scan KEEPS instead of one it breaks. The mark is written in `reparent` alone — the one function
every hand-move rides. The moved shelf keeps every disk fact it had: its `rel` still routes newly
scanned files
into it, and its subtree hangs off `parent` pointers, so a moved folder carries its folders and
its books the way a moved directory carries its tree — and a read-in-place book's address travels
on the book, so tracking, relink and the resume points never knew a move happened. For a VIRTUAL
shelf `parent` is the reader's from the start, and no scan ever writes it.

### One gesture, decided once

A card answers to three pointers that all arrive as the same `pointerdown`: a tap opens, a hold
starts a multi-select, a movement files the card somewhere else. Handled as three listeners they
race — the hold completes and the click it generates opens the book it was meant to select, or the
press drifts two pixels and cancels a gesture the reader was still making.

`components::primitives::interactions::draggable_item` decides instead. The mode is chosen once per
press and locked until the pointer is released: the hold timer firing wins, or the pointer
travelling past a 6px threshold wins, or neither happening before release means it was a tap.
Travelling past the threshold while nothing is draggable is its own fourth answer rather than a tap,
because on a touch surface that movement is a scroll and opening the card the reader scrolled past is
exactly the surprise the wrapper exists to prevent — which is why a finger is never a drag at all,
whatever the caller allows. `DraggableItemOptions` is the policy — which of the two a card allows,
and what each means — and `DraggableItemHandle` is the four pointer handlers, the one flag a card
paints itself from, and the one-shot probes that swallow the `click` and the synthetic `contextmenu`
a completed hold generates.

The wrapper decides *which* gesture a press was and stops there. What a movement then does belongs to
the caller, and on the shelf that is a session rather than a browser drag. The caller side is itself
one wiring rather than one per surface: `features::library::gestures` binds the wrapper, the session
handoff, the selection's enter/toggle, the keyboard's two halves and the right-click's ask once, and
a book card, a book row and a folder card hand it the three answers that are theirs — what the item
is called, whether a movement may lift it, and what "open" means for it.

### What a drop means

Nothing in the library rides the browser's own drag-and-drop, and the reason is not taste. Once the
engine takes a drag over, `pointerup` never reaches the element the press began on, so the card's own
"being held" flag had no release to clear it and the card stayed faded until a click somewhere else
dismissed the selection it had turned on. Two more things a browser drag cannot do at any price
decided it as well: it will not report how *long* a drag has hovered a target, which is the whole of
the fold gesture, and its image is one bitmap of the one element the press started on, so a set of
four books drags as whichever was pressed.

`features::library::dnd` is the replacement, in four pieces that each answer one question:

- `features::library::dnd::controller` owns the session: the `DragPayload` a press picked up, the
  pointer's coordinates, the target under it, and the single `end` that a release, a cancellation and
  an Escape all arrive at. A drag that cannot be stuck is a drag whose every exit goes through one
  function. Its listeners live on `window` and only while a session is live, which is what lets a
  card unmount mid-drag — a focus rescan filing it elsewhere — without taking the drag's release with
  it.
- `features::library::dnd::target` is the registry. Targets register themselves on mount and leave on
  unmount, and a move hit-tests the registry against coordinates instead of counting `dragenter` and
  `dragleave` boundaries. Boxes are read at hit-test time, so a shelf that scrolled between two moves
  is hit where it is rather than where it was.
- `features::library::dnd::effect` is the decision table: what is held, what is under the pointer,
  which part of the target's box the pointer is on, which shelf renders the target's row, and how
  long it has been there go in, and one `DropEffect` comes out. It has no DOM and no signals in it,
  which is why it is the piece with the unit tests and why a refusal is a value rather than an
  absence — a folder that would close a loop says no before the pointer arrives, so the ring that
  would have promised the drop is never drawn.
- `features::library::dnd::commit` is the only place an effect touches state, and it touches it
  through the services a menu row uses, so a dragged book persists and keeps its cover exactly as a
  filed one does. The services screen what arrives: a drop onto a shelf that already holds the very
  content goes to the conflict sheet instead of being skipped.

What a press picks up is the set's business rather than the gesture's: `features::library::selection`'s
`payload_for` answers "the whole selection when this card is in it, this card alone when it is not",
which is the rule that makes a bulk move one gesture. The visible half of that is a fade on every held
card and a ghost of their covers — four tiles at most, fanned, with a count badge for the rest — drawn
by `features::library::dnd::layer` above the content and below the sheets.

A list row is the same target with one fact and one question more. The fact is the shelf whose member
list renders the row, which the entry carries and the insertion names, so a drop inside an expanded
tree indexes that branch's own list instead of the flat order the page is showing — the seam under a
nested row used to land in the open level, silently. The lift carries the same fact back out as the
payload's source, so a reorder inside a branch takes its books off the branch and never off the
page's own shelf, which a book on both is a member of as well. The question is which PART of the row the pointer
is on: the bottom half of a book row lands the hold after its anchor, a shelf row's middle takes the
hold inside it, and its outer quarters reorder held folders beside their anchor in the level that
holds the anchor — the graph asked is the parent's own `can_nest`, and a folder asked to sibling
itself is refused. A hold with no books in it is refused by a book row at EVERY band: a row is a
seam between books and a shelf is not a book, so a folder over a book is neither a landing nor a
fold — it lands in a folder's mouth, beside its own kind on a shelf row's edge, on a crumb or on
the level's space. The band is computed once, in the session, from the row's own rectangle, so the
seam painted and the index committed cannot disagree; outside the list layout every band is the
middle one, and the grid keeps its whole-card answers without the table carrying a branch about
layouts. The tree adds the courtesy every file manager's tree gives a drag: a hold resting on a
collapsed shelf row opens it, so the way deeper is the way in. A shelf row is a LIFT as well as a
landing: a hold enters the selection with the shelf in it and a movement picks it up, by the same
wiring the folder card wears — a folder is draggable at both densities, watched or not (the move
is the hand's, and `Shelf::manual_parent` is what tells the next re-hang so), and a set of books
and folders is one gesture in either.

Two dwells hang off the same target change, and they are NOT the same question at two depths — the
difference is the whole of the design. The sink belongs to the title bar alone: at 420ms over a crumb,
the ghost stops following the pointer and sits at a third of its size on that crumb's centre. A crumb
is the one target on the page smaller than the ghost hovering it, so it is the one place where a
full-size ghost covers the thing being aimed at — the name of the level the held items are about to go
to. The shrink is also the only thing that CAN keep it readable, and that is not a stylistic
preference: the bar and the fold menu are both in a lower lane than the drag overlay, so no z-step
puts the ghost behind a crumb without putting it behind the whole shelf. A third-size plate needs no
lane; it simply stops covering the label.

Nothing on the shelf itself sinks. A folder card does not need to: it already wears the loudest marker
in the shelf's vocabulary — the accent ring, the halo and the plate lifting — so a shrink on top of
that is a second, slower answer to a question the ring answered on the frame the pointer arrived, and
it takes the covers away from a reader at the moment they are checking what they are holding. A book
is not a container at all: it is a position, which the insertion line beside it already draws, or a
fold partner, which the plate draws instead of the ghost. And the level's empty space has a box the
size of the scroll container, so its centre is the middle of the screen — sinking there is the ghost
leaving the reader's hand for a place they are not pointing at.

At 650ms a hot book arms a fold and the ghost becomes a folder card's own plate filling in — one lit
cell per item the new shelf would hold and a `+` in the next — which outranks the sink, because a
plate shrunk to a third of itself inside the card it is offering to replace is a plate nobody can
read. The dwell is longer than the hold that starts a selection on purpose: a reader crossing a shelf
rests over cards, and a fold that armed at the hold's tuning would offer a new shelf on every drag
that happened to slow down.

Which book can be a partner is a separate question from whether the reader meant one, and the two are
answered by different things. Membership of the payload decides WHICH: a book the pointer is already
carrying is a position and never a partner, so dragging a book onto itself, or a selection onto one of
its own members, reorders instead of counting that book twice — the bug a self-counting target had.
The rest decides WHETHER, and it is not a refinement: without the dwell a reorder would be unreachable
at all, because every card a drag crossed would be offering a new shelf instead of a place to land.
With both, one book rested on another is a shelf of the two, which is the smallest shelf a drag can
make and the whole of what folding a pair means. The fold is BOOK over book in both halves: folders
and crumbs never brew a shelf whatever the rest, because a fold over a folder would be a nest and a
create at once — two answers to one release — and a hold with no books in it is refused by a book
row before the dwell is ever asked, so the plate and the ring appear only for the gesture that
exists: books brewing a shelf over a book. A mixed hold folds with everything it carries, the
folders included, because the new shelf is a shelf like any other and takes both kinds.

A sunk drag is a parked drag, and it is charged for nothing. The sink caches the crumb's box with the
spot, and while the pointer stays inside that box a `pointermove` does one comparison and returns:
no `getBoundingClientRect` per registered target, no signal write, no re-render. The cache is what
makes parking free and it is stale under a scroll, which is the same promise the captured spot
already makes — a sunk ghost says the pointer has stopped moving.

The transition is the sunk state and nothing else, on one signal rather than two. A `left`/`top`
transition left on for the follow would put every frame of it 200ms behind the hand AND cost a layout
per frame, which is the one thing a drag must not spend; a second "is animating" flag kept alive for a
grace beat after the sink lifts is exactly that, held for one beat too long. So the class comes off on
the same frame the sink lifts and the follow resumes 1:1, while the grow-back stays soft on transform
and opacity alone, which the compositor runs without touching layout. Both collapse under the app's
two motion nets, so a reader who asked for no motion gets a ghost that lands in one step rather than
gliding there.

### A bar of its own

The library's bar is the reader's shape — leading cluster, centred slot, trailing cluster, the
built-in pin — filled with the shelf's jobs, and the ways the two routes differ are one vocabulary
rather than scattered facts: `ChromeSurface` (`components::shell::controller`) names the route, and
every per-route rule reads that name. The pin is remembered per surface, in one settings field each,
because unhitching the reader's bar out of a document's way says nothing about the shelf's — and the
shelf's defaults to pinned, since its bar is how the reader moves. The appearance menu drops its
page-texture section off the reader surface (and on the reader too while a reflowable document
paints its own paper — the same two facts the settings modal's Paper section gates itself on), and
the settings gear does not mount: settings are the reader's, and a button that opens a modal with
nothing to say about the shelf is a button the reader has to read and then ignore.

### A bar that can go deep

A chain of levels has no end and a title bar does, so `features::library::breadcrumb` elides the
oldest crumbs behind an ellipsis — never just one, because a single elided level costs a hover to
reach and costs the bar the width showing it would have. Whether the bar folds at all is a depth
question first: a chain shallower than four nested folders never folds, however cramped the bar is —
its crumbs truncate against each other instead, because the smallest legal fold hides two levels and
below four that leaves one lonely crumb beside the ellipsis. Past that gate, how many fold is a width
question before it is a count: every crumb (plus the ellipsis itself) is measured in a hidden probe
against the cluster's own live box, which is observed rather than polled — so a chain that grew folds
on the same frame it gets cramped, and so does a cluster the window squeezed, with no resize handler
anywhere in the fold. The count rule — keep three — is the fallback for the frames before the first measurement.
The cluster itself is squeezable (`min-w-0`, not `shrink-0`): a bar whose left refuses to shrink
answers a long chain by overflowing over the search field, which is the overlap the fold exists to
prevent, and the shell already observes the cluster elements, so the centered slot follows every
squeeze without being told. The panel is the `MenuPopover` every
other anchored menu in the app uses, which matters more than it looks: that primitive is the one place
that knows the glass toolbar row's `backdrop-filter` makes it a containing block for `position: fixed`,
and a hand-rolled panel anchored in the bar would be positioned against the row and not the viewport.

The ellipsis is its own element and not an arrow on a crumb, and that is the whole of the fix for a
confusion worth naming. An arrow on the THIRD level whose panel lists the first and second reads as
"deeper than three", because a disclosure hangs below the thing it discloses — and the elided levels
are shallower. An affordance standing for them must not itself be a level, so it claims to be nothing
but a gap. Inside, the levels are drawn in the bar's own grammar rather than as a list of rows: name,
chevron, name. The chevron trails its crumb and shares its flex item, so a line ends on `4 >` and
the next begins on `5`; a leading chevron would put a stray `>` at the head of every line but the
first. The panel's width is measured rather than picked, and its chain is packed rather than
wrapped: the chain is drawn once more inside the panel as an invisible, unwrapped ruler, and on
open — and on every resize while the panel is open — the crumb boxes are laid greedily against a
budget of the whole window minus breathing room, because a chain the screen can hold on one line is
held on one line. The panel takes the widest packed row's width, and each row paints its own
surface, so a short second row is a short rectangle rather than a wide empty one dragging along
behind it. A crumb wider than the whole budget gets a row to itself: a level is never dropped, and
the panel never hangs off the screen.

It opens on hover and closes one beat after the pointer leaves, because a click is already taken by
the crumb it lands on. The beat is owned by an effect on "is the pointer over it" rather than by a
parked timer, so arming and cancelling the close are the same write and there is exactly one timer.
ArrowDown opens it too, which is not a nicety: the elided levels are on no other surface, so without a
keyboard path a chain deeper than the bar keeps would be navigable by mouse only.

Every crumb, elided ones included, is a drop target, which is the only way to reach a deep level with
a hand full of books — and the reason the panel has to be openable DURING a drag. A drag cannot raise
a `mouseenter`: the card the press began on holds the pointer capture, and a captured pointer reports
its boundary events to the capture target alone. So while a drag is live the ellipsis opens from the
session's hot target instead, which is the same geometry the drop is decided by and the one thing under
a capture that still tells the truth. The ellipsis is a target and not a drop: it stands for several
levels and names none of them, so resting on it opens the panel and releasing on it does nothing —
filing onto a level whose name the reader cannot see is a filing they cannot check.

### What a right-click is

A card used to answer a right-click with the removal receipt and nothing else, which is one row of a
menu wearing the whole gesture. `features::library::context_menu` is the shelf's answer now: one host
and one signal, asked by every surface that can be right-clicked — a book card, a list row, a folder,
the empty level — so four surfaces do not own four placements, four dismissals and four sets of rows
to keep in step. The payload says which menu, and it carries the facts rather than an id, because a
row that asked the library what it was pointing at would be reading a list a rescan can change between
the click and the row.

Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not start a drag: a menu row is clicked with a pointer
that has already been released, so a session begun from one would have no pointer to follow and no
release to end it, and the next click anywhere would be the drop. And it does not fork a second shelf
picker — "file these somewhere" is the selection bar's popover, which is on screen whenever a
selection is. The actions both surfaces offer are one function each in
`features::library::selection` for that reason: a bar and a menu that each minted a shelf would
eventually differ about whether to drill into it.

A card's right-click is stopped before the hold's exhaust is even asked about. A completed hold
answers with a synthetic `contextmenu` on some platforms, and one that went on to bubble would open
the LEVEL's menu under the finger that was busy selecting.

The current shelf's crumb carries the shelf's own popover: a rename in place — the thing being
named is the thing being typed over, so no dialog has to describe a shelf the reader can already
see — and the removal, with the watched-folder note when one applies. It is the second door to
both acts beside the right-click's folder menu, and the only door to a rename.
