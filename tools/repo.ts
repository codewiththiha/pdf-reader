// The repo-reading prelude the check tools share.
//
// Six tools under `tools/` answer questions about this repository's own
// text: versions that have to agree, formats declared in three places, event
// names spelled in two languages, DOM names spelled in two, module paths named
// in comments, constants mirrored across a language boundary. Each of them
// began the same way — resolve the repo root, read a file, walk the tree past
// the directories that are not source — and each
// carried its own byte-identical copy of those four things. Identical copies
// stay in step right up to the day a new build directory appears and one script
// starts scanning it while the others do not. This is the single copy.
//
// Nothing here knows what any check is FOR; the parsing stays with the tools.
//
// Emitted to `scripts/repo.js` like everything else in this directory: `tools/`
// is source, `scripts/` is generated output (see tsconfig.tools.json).
