//! Zombie retention: the pure bookkeeping that lets freshly evicted items
//! stay rendered for a short grace period.
//!
//! A virtualizer's window moves for two reasons that benefit from a bridge:
//! fast scrolls (an item blinks out and back when the window jitters around
//! a fling) and a zoom's geometry commit (the reader has been looking at a
//! continuously scaled surface; the commit reinstalls geometry at the new
//! scale and the window jumps, evicting pages that are still on screen).
//! Retaining those items briefly — as [`RetainedItem`]s with an expiry —
//! keeps their DOM alive across the change so nothing visibly pops.
//!
//! This module is pure (host-testable): the reactive adapter in
//! [`crate::virtualizer`] owns the signals and the expiry timer, and only
//! the merge/diff arithmetic lives here. The set is always BOUNDED —
//! `max_retained` prunes the oldest first — so retention can never turn
//! windowing into "mount everything".
