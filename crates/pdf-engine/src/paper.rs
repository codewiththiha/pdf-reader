//! The paper session: the `pdf-paper` crate's brain, wired to the engine's
//! eyes.
//!
//! Every colour decision — which pages to sample, what a page's paper is,
//! what the backdrop should show right now — lives in the pure crate and in
//! this state machine. The TS engine keeps only the pixel plumbing: it
//! stashes a raw frame per live render, renders offscreen samples on
//! request, remembers one cached colour per document path, and paints
//! whatever `--pdf-paper` it is told to.
//!
//! The lifecycle, in one breath:
//!
//! * [`configure`] — the reader's settings (blend on/off, mode, area, scan
//!   budget). A scan starts whenever the FIXED mode is live for a book with
//!   no colour yet — but only once the reader has PAINTED a page, because the
//!   scan's offscreen renders share the pdf.js worker with the first visible
//!   render and that render wins by right. A detection-area change
//!   invalidates everything, because a histogram fed through one area says
//!   nothing about the other.
//! * [`document_open`] — a fresh book: reset, publish nothing until a colour
//!   is known, and ask the engine's cache before the reader view mounts (the
//!   open flow calls this synchronously, ahead of the Ready flip). A cache
//!   hit (under the SAME detection area) repaints the very first frame with
//!   zero sampling; a miss arms nothing — the scan waits for the reader's
//!   first paint.
//! * [`live_frame`] — after every successful render, the one stashed raw
//!   frame feeds the per-page palette (continuous mode's raw material) and
//!   the interim colour (the fixed mode's stand-in until the scan lands).
//!   The first frame is also the scan's starting gun.
//! * [`document_close`] — an interrupted fixed scan BANKS its partial answer
//!   (the pooled dominant of the pages it reached) before forgetting the
//!   book, so the next open reuses it instead of re-sampling every page up
//!   to the interruption point.
//! * [`position`] — per scroll tick in continuous mode: the viewport's
//!   visible-paint-weighted mean page index. The palette interpolates along
//!   its ladder at exactly that point, so the backdrop meets the pages where
//!   they are — no seam at the dominant-page handover, which is what the
//!   old page-pair blend could not do.
//!
//! Every spawned task carries the session's generation token and re-checks
//! it after each `await`, so a sample or scan page started for one book can
//! never land in the next.
