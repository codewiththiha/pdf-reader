//! Serde types that mirror the pdf.js engine's return shapes.
//!
//! The engine resolves `{ok:true, ...}` objects whose field names are camelCase
//! (they come straight from JS). These structs are deserialized via
//! serde_wasm_bindgen after the `ok` flag is checked in crate::api::engine.
//!
//! CONTRACT: field names are the wire contract with pdfEngine.js.
