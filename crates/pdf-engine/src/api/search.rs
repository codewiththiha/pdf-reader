//! Full-text search, Rust side: an in-process index over the document's
//! extracted text.
//!
//! The pdf.js worker can only extract text in the browser, so the engine (JS)
//! hands each page over via `bridge::extract_page_text` and everything after
//! that — lowercasing, occurrence matching, snippet building, result ordering
//! — happens here, on the wasm heap. The index is rebuilt on document open
//! (and lazily by the search effect if it isn't), after which a query is a
//! pure in-Rust scan: no pdf.js round trip, no per-query text extraction.
//!
//! Extraction is concurrent in bounded batches: [`SEARCH_PAGE_CONCURRENCY`]
//! pages in flight per turn, so the pdf.js worker is never flooded and live
//! page renders keep their share of it. Between turns the builder's future
//! falls back to Pending awaiting the next pdf.js round trip, so the event
//! loop (and the reader's own renders) runs between turns without a busy
//! wait — a textbook-sized index build stays responsive.
