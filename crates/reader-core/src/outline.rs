//! The document's chapter tree, in the shape the reader displays.

//! One node type for every format, which is the point: the outline panel, the
//! floating label and the reveal-on-page-turn memo all take a
//! `Vec<OutlineNode>` and never ask whether the chapters came from a PDF's
//! `/Outlines` dictionary (resolved through the engine, in
//! `pdf_core::outline`) or from a Markdown file's `#` headings (derived while
//! the blocks are paginated, in `md_core::outline`). A format that can name
//! where its sections start can fill the sidebar.
//!
//! The nodes are stored flattened, in document order, with the nesting depth
//! as a field — the panel indents rather than recurses, and a page change only
//! needs the last entry whose page is at or before it.
