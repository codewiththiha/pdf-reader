//! The reader's search model, the scan both pipelines run, and the maths the
//! search UI runs on.
//!
//! Both pipelines answer in this shape: the PDF side builds it from the
//! engine's page-text index (`pdf_core::search`), a reflowable document from
//! `reflow_core::search`, and the results list, the cycling and the scroll
//! reveal are the same code for either. That is why it lives here rather than
//! beside either parser.
//!
//! The SCAN lives here for the same reason, and a sharper one: a match carries
//! an ordinal — which occurrence of the query this is — and the thing that
//! paints a box over the hit counts occurrences again, independently, to find
//! which of its boxes that ordinal names. Two scanners are two chances to
//! disagree about what an occurrence is, so there is one ([`occurrence_spans`]),
//! and the snippet window next to it ([`snippet`]) for the same reason.
//!
//! The engine returns ONE ENTRY PER OCCURRENCE in document order, not one per
//! page: "next result" means the next match, which is usually still on the
//! current page. A match's rect is in scale-1 CSS px relative to its page's
//! top-left; the UI multiplies by the current scale to place it.
