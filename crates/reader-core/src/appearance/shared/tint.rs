//! The tint maths BOTH pipelines share: the sRGB->OKLCH hue mapping and
//! the per-token OKLCH shift that preserves each token's lightness.
//!
//! The PDF pipeline feeds these numbers into the CSS filter chain and the

//! page tokens. Keeping the mapping and the per-token chroma ceilings here
//! — and nowhere else — is what makes one slider drive both formats onto
//! the same hue at the same strength.
