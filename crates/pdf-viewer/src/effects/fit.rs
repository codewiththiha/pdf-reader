//! `zoom_system` drives `display_scale` on rAF, re-scaling `page_heights` and

//! `render_scale` once. Retargeting is first-class (mashing `+` re-aims from
//! wherever the animation is), and `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses the
//! animation to a single anchored step.

        // debounce below then commits ONE crisp render when the slide settles.
