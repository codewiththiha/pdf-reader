//! One book: its identity, where its bytes live, and where the reader left off.
//!
//! This file is the schema — [`Fingerprint`], [`Origin`], [`Book`] and the [`Row`]
//! a library's list actually holds — and the rules that act on rows live in the
//! modules beside it, one file per question:
//!
//! | module | the question |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`read`] | where the reader left off, and how a read is written down |
//! | [`naming`] | what a book is called, and what to call the second one |
//! | [`merge`] | how two books that turn out to be one fold back into one |
//! | [`check`] | what a walk's measurement does to the rows it lands on |
//! | [`query`] | looking a row up by id, by address, or by either |
//! | [`sanitize`] | making a persisted list of rows internally valid |
//!
//! Everything is re-exported here, so a caller says `book::find_row` and not which
//! file of this module it happens to live in: the split is this crate's business
//! and the address is the library's.
//!
//! A book is the library's row and the reader's resume point at once — the
//! page, the page count and the reflowable stream fraction used to live on a
//! separate "recent books" record, which meant the same path was written down
//! twice and the two copies drifted (import a folder and a book had an
//! address with no resume point; open it and the resume point had no shelf).
//! One record ends that: [`Book`] carries both, and opening a document is an
//! update to the book rather than an insert into a second list.
