//! Tracking as a tree, not a bool.
//!
//! A watched folder used to carry one root-level flag — `FolderOpts::watch` —
//! for the WHOLE tree it imported. Every question about "is this bit of the
//! tree tracked" then had exactly one unit to ask it of: the root. There was no
//! data structure smaller than "the whole imported tree" that could hold a
//! tracking decision, so there was no code path that could ever offer
//! subfolder-level control — turning tracking off for one subfolder of a watched
//! import, or on for a new import under an already-tracked ancestor, was not a
//! missing `if` but a missing field.
//!
//! This is the field. A [`TrackingTree`] is a set of per-rung overrides keyed by
//! the same rung paths a folder's `shelf_map` uses (`""` is the root itself),
//! and [`TrackingTree::resolve`] walks a rung's chain up to the root and takes
//! the first explicit decision it finds. The old root-level flag is exactly
//! `resolve("")`, so a tree with one `set("", Track::On)` behaves as the bool
//! did — a one-line migration rather than a rewrite of every call site — while a
//! deeper `set` is the subfolder control the bool could not express.
//!
//! Pure and persisted: no I/O, no signals, just a map and the inheritance rule,
//! so the decisions that are easy to get wrong (which override wins, what an
//! unset rung inherits) are host-testable rather than something you discover by
//! pointing the app at a real folder.
