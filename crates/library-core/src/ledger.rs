//! The rescan ledger: what a scan of a watched folder DOES.
//!
//! This is the module the feature's edge cases live in. A rescan runs on every
//! window focus, so every case below happens repeatedly and silently — a wrong
//! answer is not a crash, it is a book that comes back after the reader
//! deleted it, or a library that gains a duplicate every time the window is
//! clicked. [`diff_folder`] is a pure function so each row of the decision
//! table is a test, and the tests below ARE the specification.
//!
//! The table, in full:
//!
//! | Scan finds a fingerprint…            | Book exists? | This folder placed it? | Removed from it? | Action   |
//! |--------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|----------|
//! | not seen before                      | –            | –                      | –                | `Add`    |
//! | known, at the address already stored | yes          | yes                    | –                | `Skip`   |
//! | known, at a DIFFERENT address        | yes          | yes                    | –                | `Relink` |
//! | known, but the book is missing       | yes          | no                     | –                | `Relink` |
//! | known, placed by another folder      | yes          | no                     | –                | `Skip`   |
//! | seen here, but the row is gone       | no           | yes                    | –                | `Skip`   |
//! | anything                             | –            | –                      | yes              | `Skip`   |
//!
//! Row 3 is the "file moved on disk inside the watched tree" case: the address
//! is stale, the book is not, so the address is rewritten and every shelf
//! membership survives untouched. Row 4 is the same heal arriving from a
//! different folder than the one that placed the book — a book whose address
//! vanished is worth relinking whoever finds it. Row 5 is the same content in
//! two watched folders: the first one placed it, the second leaves it alone.
//! Row 6 is the reader having dragged a book off this folder's shelf (or the
//! row having been dropped by a storage trim): the fingerprint stays in
//! [`crate::folder::WatchedFolder::placed`], so the book is never re-added —
//! which is the "import back only the genuinely new ones" rule.
//!
//! Rows 3 and 4 have one exception, and it is the copy the library made. A
//! stored row records the address its bytes came from, and a walk standing on
//! THAT address has not found a book that moved: it has found the original of a
//! copy the library holds. There is no address to rewrite — the copy's
//! provenance already names this file — so a rescan is quiet. Reading it as a
//! move instead rewrote a provenance to itself and reported a relink on every
//! window focus, forever, for every book the library had copied. An explicit
//! import does not stay quiet, and the difference is the two tables' own: the
//! file the reader asked for is not the copy the library made, so it gets a
//! book of its own.
//!
//! The last row is the tombstone, and it is checked FIRST: a book the reader
//! deliberately removed is refused even when everything else about it says
//! "new". A MOVED-OUT log is the one tombstone no scan drops, because what it
//! records is not a book that is gone but a file the library answered for once:
//! see [`prune_tombstones`].
//!
//! ## Two tables, because two questions are asked
//!
//! The table above is a RESCAN's answer — the passive walk a window focus
//! triggers, where "stay out" is the whole point of a tombstone and a
//! fingerprint this folder placed before is a book the reader filed away on
//! purpose. [`diff_import`] is an EXPLICIT import's answer, and two of its rows
//! lean the other way: a removal is an answer to "should this come back on its
//! own", not to "the reader is asking for it again". Import a folder you emptied
//! last week and the tombstones stand aside, because refusing them would make
//! "import this folder" silently refuse exactly the books the reader removed
//! from it — a broken import wearing a rule's clothes. Everything else is the
//! rescan's answer unchanged: a book the library holds at this address is a
//! Skip, at another address a Relink.
