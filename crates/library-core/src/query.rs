//! The titlebar search: which books a query keeps, which shelves, and which
//! books the bar suggests while the reader is still typing.
//!
//! Client-side and over three fields, because that is all a library is: the
//! name the document gave (or the file stem, when it gave none), the author,
//! and the address. Nothing here is indexed — a few thousand string comparisons
//! per keystroke is well inside a frame, and an index would be a second thing
//! to keep in step with the list it describes. The fuzzy pass is likewise a
//! single walk per field per term: no backtracking, one score, and the only
//! allocation is the folded text the walk reads.
//!
//! Shelves are searched by name through the same rule ([`matches_terms`]),
//! because a page showing books a query kept and shelves it did not is two
//! searches wearing one text box.
//!
//! ## Two ways a term matches
//!
//! A term matches a field either as a SUBSTRING — case-folded, anywhere, the
//! way search has always worked here — or, when it is not a substring, as an
//! in-order SUBSEQUENCE that scores well enough: the fuzzy half, so `mthmtcl`
//! still finds *Mathematical Proofs* and a half-remembered title survives a
//! missing vowel. A subsequence that is too scattered for its length is not a
//! match: fuzzy that matches everything is a shuffle, not a search.
//!
//! Scoring rewards the shapes a reader actually types: runs of consecutive
//! characters, starts of words (`-`, `_`, `.`, `/`, `:`, space), and the very
//! start of the field; it charges for the gaps between matched characters. A
//! substring always matches, whatever its position.
//!
//! Suggestions rank books by the best field per term — title outweighs author
//! outweighs address, because a reader naming a book means its name first —
//! and hand back the matched character spans so the bar can light them up.
