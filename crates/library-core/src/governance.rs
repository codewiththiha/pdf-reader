//! One answer to "who owns this path", instead of four.
//!
//! Four places in the library each walked the watched-folder list and the shelf
//! list to answer a variation of the same question — which read-at-place tree's
//! ledger speaks for this ground, and which of its shelves is still standing:
//!
//!   * the import gate's `covered_of` — the standing shelf a tree already holds
//!     for a pick of ground, which turns a re-import into a reconciliation;
//!   * the import gate's `displaced_member` — a member of one tree standing
//!     outside it, which an explicit run folds back;
//!   * [`crate::shelf::family_for`] — the deepest in-place tree a ground belongs
//!     to but is not standing in, which an import folds into;
//!   * the departure's `converts_on_move_to` — whether the folder that placed a
//!     book still names the shelf it is leaving as the rung for its address.
//!
//! Each re-derived "iterate the in-place folders, walk [`crate::folder::rel_under`],
//! read the `shelf_map`, check the shelf stands" for itself: four places to keep
//! in step and four sets of edge cases waiting to drift. This module is the one
//! resolver they read. It is pure and borrowed — built from the two lists a
//! caller already holds, asked, and dropped inside one decision — so the
//! arithmetic lives here once and a host test can name the case it asserts.
//!
//! `displaced_member` stays in the gate: it is asked of a walk's own findings
//! and the live shelf list rather than of the two lists alone, so it is a caller
//! of this resolver's vocabulary rather than a method on it. The other three
//! are here.
