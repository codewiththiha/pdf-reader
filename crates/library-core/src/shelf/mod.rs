//! Shelves: an ordered list of book ids, and the two kinds that produce one.
//!
//! A shelf holds membership and nothing else — no copies, no paths, no
//! filesystem intent. That is what makes dragging a book between shelves safe
//! by construction: the only thing a drop can change is an ordered list of
//! ids, so a read-in-place book can be filed anywhere in the app without the
//! file it points at ever being touched.
//!
//! "All" is deliberately not a shelf. Every book is in it by definition, so
//! storing it would be a second copy of the book list that has to be kept in
//! sync forever; [`ALL_SHELF`] is the id the UI uses for that pseudo-shelf and
//! [`find`] answers `None` for it, which is how a caller tells the two
//! apart.
//!
//! ## Nesting
//!
//! [`Shelf::parent`] makes the shelves a forest rather than a list: the root
//! level is the shelves whose parent is `None`, and a level inside a shelf is
//! [`children_of`] on that shelf's id. Nesting is the one relationship in this
//! module that can be wrong in a way no single row shows — a shelf filed inside
//! itself, or inside one of its own children, is a folder that renders nowhere
//! and can never be opened again. So the graph is guarded twice: [`can_nest`]
//! refuses the drop before it is written, and [`sanitize`] cuts any cycle a
//! hand-edited blob carries, because a rule only enforced on the way in is a
//! rule one restored backup can break.
//!
//! Nesting is NOT the same thing as [`ShelfKind::Folder`]'s `rel`. `rel` is a
//! subfolder's address inside a watched directory's tree — a rescan key, owned
//! by the filesystem. For a folder shelf `parent` starts as its projection —
//! the tree on disk is the tree on the shelf, and a scan re-hangs the folder's
//! shelves on the rungs their `rel` names. For a virtual shelf `parent` is the
//! reader's from the start, and no scan ever writes it.
//!
//! ## The hand and the disk
//!
//! What a hand-move of a folder shelf MEANS depends on how its folder is read,
//! and [`departs_on_move`] is the one answer. A shelf of a COPYING folder is
//! the library's own already: the move is the reader's, [`reparent`] takes it
//! and marks the row [`Shelf::manual_parent`], and the next re-hang passes it
//! by. A shelf of a READ-AT-PLACE folder is the OS directory itself — the way
//! a linked book is the OS file itself — so a hand cannot take it off the rung
//! the tree names for it: the move is a DEPARTURE, the shelf's own spelling of
//! what a linked book leaving its rung does, and it leaves as a copy the
//! library owns, asked before the copy is made. The original stays on disk and
//! comes back to the tree on the next import, lit, exactly as a departed
//! book's file does. The departure itself — the ask, the copies, the ledger's
//! zone going free — is the library services' business; what this crate owns
//! is the rule of which moves are departures, the seat a hand-move is measured
//! against, and the subtree that rides with the shelf the hand named.
