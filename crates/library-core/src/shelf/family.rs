/// gate's "already in the library" answer rather than a family to fold back
/// into.
///
/// The answer is the tree's id and the rung key the ground names in it — the
/// two facts an import's fold and a move's "put it back" both run on
/// (`crate::ledger` folds through the import's own `reclaim_rung`), from the
/// one lookup every family question reads. The deepest tree wins because a
/// nested in-place import is the closer family: its rung is the seat the
/// ground's own directory names.

/// ledger names for its rung.
///
/// The negatives are as load-bearing as the positive, and each is the book
/// departure's rule read one level up. A VIRTUAL shelf is the reader's own
/// and simply moves. A shelf of a COPYING folder is the library's own already
/// — no ledger waits on its rung, and the move is the membership edit it has
/// always been. A RE-ORDER on the seat a shelf already hangs on copies
/// nothing: the same parent is the same ground. And a move BACK onto the seat
/// is a return rather than a departure: [`reparent`] takes the hand's shelf
/// off the mark and gives the scan its place back.
///
/// Everywhere else is a departure, **including another rung of the very tree
/// that named the shelf.** What ties a read-at-place shelf to its folder is
/// the seat its directory stands on, not membership of the folder's shelf
/// tree: a rung dragged from `Fiction/` to `Sci-Fi/` is no longer where the
/// ledger says it is, and a linked shelf wearing a place it was dragged off
/// is a shelf the next import of that folder collides with instead of coming
/// home to. The seat is the LEDGER's answer — the folder's `shelf_map` at the
/// rung above — which is the same map [`crate::folder::WatchedFolder::rungs_for`]
/// names a file's rung from, so a shelf and the books standing on it cannot
/// disagree about the ground they left.
