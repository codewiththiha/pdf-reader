//! The two shapes this library was persisted as before the one it is now, and
//! the migrations from each.
//!
//! Kept beside [`super::LibraryBlob`] rather than in the app, because a migration
//! is a rule about the library's shape and a rule is something a test can call:
//! `cargo test -p library-core` holds both of them to account, and a migration
//! only the browser could run is a migration nobody has ever seen fail.
//!
//! Both are one-way in effect and leave the key they read alone, so a reader who
//! downgrades still finds the library the build they downgraded to wrote. The
//! first save after a migrated load is what puts the new blob under its own key
//! (see `src/storage/mod.rs`).
//!
//! A `v1` row carries no measurement, so a migrated book gets a
//! [`Fingerprint::placeholder`] and the [`Book::fp_pending`] mark, and
//! [`super::LibraryBlob::awaiting_check`] holds every watched folder's rescan off
//! until the first path check replaces it — a real fingerprint compared against a
//! placeholder matches nothing, so a rescan that ran early would add a second copy
//! of every book already on the shelf.
