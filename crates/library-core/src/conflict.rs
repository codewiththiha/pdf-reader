//! The one question the library asks about a name: does the level this is
//! going to already hold a book called that?
//!
//! Nothing else about duplicates is a dialog. A second copy of one file is a
//! naming problem with a naming answer — the counter a file manager appends —
//! and a reader who wants a pointer rather than a copy gets a row that points
//! ([`crate::book::Row::Link`]). So this module is one predicate
//! ([`collide`]), one namer ([`next_name`]) and the three answers
//! ([`Answer`]) the sheet offers when the predicate says yes.
//!
//! ## Why names and not content
//!
//! The question used to be asked of a file's fingerprint, which made it a
//! question about bytes: two rows of one file shared an address, and with it
//! their highlights, their resume point and their removal, so keeping both
//! meant two books that could not be told apart by anything the reader could
//! see. Names are what a shelf is: a reader looking at two rows called `1` and
//! `1_1` knows they are two books, and a reader looking at two rows both
//! called `1` does not. So the collision is a name collision, on the level the
//! arrival is going to, and everything the fingerprint used to decide is now
//! either a naming decision ([`next_name`]) or a pointer ([`Answer::AsLink`]).
//!
//! Fingerprints are not gone from the library — a watched folder's rescan
//! ([`crate::ledger`]) and a path check ([`crate::book::apply_check`]) still
//! need one, because "is this the file I already placed" is a question about
//! bytes and only bytes can answer it. They are gone from this module, which
//! asks a different question.
//!
//! ## What never asks
//!
//! A link, on either side: it is not a book, so it is never a collision and
//! never the thing collided with. The row being moved itself, because a
//! reorder is not an arrival. A level that holds no book of that name, which
//! includes an empty folder and includes the shelf holding `1_1` when `1`
//! arrives — different names are different books, and a counter a previous
//! answer minted is not a reason to ask again.
//!
//! Pure, and host-tested: no state, no signals, no storage, so the four rules
//! above are assertions rather than behaviours.
