//! Pure layout math shared by both view modes (single page + continuous).
//! No wasm deps — unit-testable on the host.
//!
//! The continuous layout is a vertical column of pages separated by `gap` px:
//!   * `document`      — the cached [`DocumentLayout`] (structure + queries)
//!   * `anchor`        — the anchored-scroll zoom math
//!   * `viewport`      — which thumbnail-grid rows overlap the viewport
//!   * here            — the shared constants/types and the one-shot
//!     convenience wrappers over [`DocumentLayout`] for cold callers
