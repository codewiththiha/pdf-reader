//! Device-pixel grid snapping for page geometry.
//!
//! This is the PDF pipeline's presentation boundary, and it lives beside the
//! canvas it protects: the crate that owns the page frame owns the rule that a
//! page frame's edges are whole device pixels. Both page strips (the raster one
//! and the reflowable one) snap through it, so the joint between two sheets is
//! the same arithmetic whichever painted them.
//!
//! Every page is a stack of independently rasterized compositor layers: the
//! canvas (which carries `mix-blend-mode`, plus `filter` in live mode), the
//! texture `::before` overlay, and the backdrop behind them (`.reader-bg`, or
//! its blend `::after`). The compositor snaps each layer's paint rect to the
//! DEVICE pixel grid, but page geometry is `intrinsic_size × zoom_scale` — a
//! product that is almost never a whole number of device pixels once the
//! display's `devicePixelRatio` is fractional (125% / 150% / 175% scaling on
//! Windows, and any browser zoom).
//!
//! When two adjacent rects round in opposite directions the result is either
//! a one-device-pixel GAP — the dark backdrop showing through as a hairline —
//! or a one-device-pixel OVERLAP, where two blended paper surfaces compose on
//! the same row and read as a near-black line. That is the thin line seen at
//! the joint between two pages in no-gap mode and along the sides of a page
//! against the gutter, and it is why it comes and goes with the zoom level:
//! at some scales the fractional part happens to vanish.
//!
//! The cure is to write no fractional geometry in the first place. Every
//! value that ends up as a page's CSS size or position goes through
//! [`snap_px`] at the boundary, so neighbouring layers always resolve to the
//! same device-pixel edge. Internal maths (scale ratios, anchoring, the
//! virtualizer's own model) keeps working in raw values — the snap is a
//! presentation concern, and at under one device pixel per page the rounding
//! never accumulates into a visible offset.

/// Round `v` (CSS px) to the nearest whole device pixel for a display whose
/// device-pixel ratio is `dpr`.
///
/// Split from [`snap_px`] so the arithmetic is testable off the browser: the
/// only thing the wasm-only half adds is the ratio itself.
pub fn snap_to(v: f64, dpr: f64) -> f64 {
    // A non-finite or nonsensical ratio (some headless environments report 0)
    // would turn a good coordinate into NaN; pass the value through instead.
