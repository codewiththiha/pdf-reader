//! The library's OS touch-points: walking a folder, measuring a file, copying
//! one into the app's store, and deleting a copy the app made.
//!
//! Deliberately raw IO and nothing else. Every *decision* — which files a
//! folder admits, what a rescan does about a file it has seen before, where a
//! book lands on a shelf — is `library_core`'s, running in the frontend where
//! the library state lives. This module answers the questions only a process
//! with a filesystem can answer, and hands back the measurements:
//!
//!   * [`scan_folder`] walks a tree and returns [`FoundFile`] rows, already
//!     filtered by the folder's own options, so a folder of forty thousand
//!     screenshots does not cross the wire;
//!   * [`verify_paths`] re-measures addresses the library already holds — what
//!     sets a book `missing`, and what replaces a migrated book's placeholder
//!     fingerprint with a real one;
//!   * [`store_books`] copies into `<app_data_dir>/Library/items/<id>/`, the only
//!     directory this module ever writes to, and stamps each copy with its own
//!     modification time so it measures as the file it is rather than as the
//!     one it came from ([`own_stamp`]);
//!   * [`delete_stored`] removes a copy, and refuses anything outside it;
//!   * [`relocate_stored`] moves a copy out of the old flat store into the
//!     book's own item folder, refusing either end that is not inside it;
//!   * [`copy_beside`] copies ONE document beside itself — the read-at-place
//!     half of a duplicate — under a counter name the frontend minted, into
//!     the original's own directory and nowhere else;
//!   * [`reveal_in_folder`] hands a path to the OS file manager — the one
//!     verb here that neither measures nor writes, and the one with no
//!     document gate, because a shelf's DIRECTORY is as revealable as a
//!     book's file and opening a file manager on a path the reader pointed
//!     at is the whole of what it does.
//!
//! Progress is emitted on [`PROGRESS_EVENT`] rather than returned, because
//! walking a large folder takes longer than a UI is willing to look frozen.
//! Completion is NOT emitted: the frontend owns the task list, and a backend
//! that also declared "done" would be a second opinion about a state only one
//! side can see — a scan is usually followed by copies, and a "done" between
//! them would close the card early.
//!
//! The gates here are the crate's existing filesystem gate
//! (`ensure_readable_document`): these commands are reachable from a webview
//! that parses untrusted documents, so a path with no document suffix is
//! refused outright rather than measured, copied or deleted.
